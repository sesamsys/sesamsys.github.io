<p class="intro">I'm going to cut you into little pieces. With an ice skate.</p>

<p>I was reading through the Wiki page for the Pink Floyd song when I stumbled upon this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hungarian figure skater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krisztina_Czak%C3%B3">Krisztina Czak√≥</a> used "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_These_Days_(Pink_Floyd_song)">One of These Days</a>" (along with "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond">Shine On You Crazy Diamond</a>") as the music for her long program at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Winter_Olympics">1992 Winter Olympics</a>, <strong>one of the few times that a classic rock song has ever been featured in an elite-level ice skating competition</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>She was barely a few months older than 13 at the time. Now I don't know much about figure skating (other than it is nice to watch) but awesomeness of this magnitude I couldn't let go unposted.</p>
