<p>Neil <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2006/11/what-i-did-next.html">wrote</a> "<em>the problem with blogging is that when things get interesting, you don't get time to write about it</em>" And if someone, he knows.</p>
<p>This is not the case with me.</p>
<p>I'm just plain lazy.</p>
<p>Also, I found out today that one can add album artwork himself to iTunes when it's not available for download. A couple of hours well spent googling for album covers in reasonably high resolution for my music.</p>
<p>*prods Firefox* Hey, you shouldn't underline "googling". Since June 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_(verb)">to google</a> is officially an English verb. Check the latest edition of Oxford English Dictionary or Merriam-Webster.</p>
