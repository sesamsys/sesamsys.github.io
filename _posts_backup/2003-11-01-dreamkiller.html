<p>I am overly tired of today. All day I was desperately trying to create something. I asked for a dynamic webspace with PHP at my service provider. I thought, a new technology deserves a new design as well. So I spent most of yesterday and six hours of today with designing. Result? Nothing: not a single original idea, not a piece that worth keeping. Additional costs: pounding headache, anger, disappointment. I am getting to hate the name Dreamweaver. It is so right you have dreams but what if you don't know how to weave?</p>
<p>Yes, I know I didn't update. Usual stuff. I am lazy like hell and always tired - if not physically then mentally. Should see a doc, mark my words.</p>
