<p><a href="http://apuka.qqriq.com/2016/01/apple-watch-10.html?m=1" target="_blank">Ottó Oláh wrote an extensive review</a> of his (and his wife's) experiences with the first generation Apple Watch. It's a long but very interesting read. (If you know Hungarian, that is.)</p>
<p>Based on this I can see myself using an Apple Watch for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of notifications I receive only warrant a glance. Fishing out my ample sized iPhone 6 Plus from wherever it lies at the moment can be a hassle.</li>
<li>At work during meetings it's much less of a distraction to look at a watch to evaluate a notification than constantly glancing at a phone.</li>
<li>I didn't know about the navigation feature of the watch. It sounds pretty useful especially when I drive alone and can't put the phone somewhere I can see. (Parents' car does not have a phone holder.)</li>
<li>Being able to reply to messages using the voice recognition during a run sounds like a dream come true. Stopping and handling the phone is an unwelcome chore, and often I don't have the luxury of running without it: I have to remain accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I want one? A resounding yes. Will I buy one? Very unlikely. For now, at least.</p>
