    He kept peeking in though! As if I'd lie about not having a TV...

    Well, OK, I have one but it hasn't been switched on for months now.

  content: Indeed, in an average train car there are at least three salarymen watching
    baseball on their phones. The quality is usually bad though and it frequently
    stops to buffer, but they don't seem to mind.

<p>The NHK guy came to visit again, like clockwork:</p>
<blockquote><p>'I'm from the NHK and I came to collect the television fee.'<br />
'I don't watch TV, I don't have one.'<br />
'On your computer then?'<br />
'I don't watch TV.'<br />
'OK, so on your mobile.'<br />
'I don't watch TV.'<br />
'Oh.'</p></blockquote>
<p>I swear they are getting worse every time...</p>
