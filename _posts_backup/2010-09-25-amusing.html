  content: And here we all have the high hopes of "well with a japanese university
    behind my back, i'll get a good job in no time!" Not so bright and shiny after
    all...?

  content: Depends if you actually finish it or not, I guess. But even then, I don't
    think it is particularly bright or unusually shiny anyway. (Even though I wouldn't
    count on myself as a definitive ray of Hello Kitty pink sunshine, when it comes
    to optimism.)

<p>Today there was a birthday celebration for one of my friends. The 25th SPAR Marathon is tomorrow, for which I have started training a couple of months ago. There are several movies playing right now that I'd like to watch such as Inception or the new Resident Evil: Afterlife. I learned on Facebook that there is a World Press Photo exhibition in Budapest. Epica has a gig here on October 2, also some time later in Vienna. And so on and so forth, I could add another dozen things.</p>
<p>Well, I'll be taking part in none of these due to a complete lack of income.</p>
<p>Harsh reality aside it seems amusing that not much seem to have changed since 8 years ago when I wrote my first post.</p>
