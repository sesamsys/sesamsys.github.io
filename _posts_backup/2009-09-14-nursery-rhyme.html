<p>A man of words and not of deeds<br />
Is like a garden full of weeds<br />
And when the weeds begin to grow<br />
It's like a garden full of snow<br />
And when the snow begins to fall<br />
It's like a bird upon the wall<br />
And when the bird away does fly<br />
It's like an eagle in the sky<br />
And when the sky begins to roar<br />
It's like a lion at the door<br />
And when the door begins to crack<br />
It's like a stick across your back<br />
And when your back begins to smart<br />
It's like a penknife in your heart<br />
And when your heart begins to bleed<br />
You're dead, and dead, and dead indeed.</p>
