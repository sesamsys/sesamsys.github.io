<p>As far as I remember I haven't mentioned here that it is freezing cold this week. At least in Hungarian terms. I think it is not the very low temperature that makes people chill to the bones but the sharp wind and the suddenness of the frosty weather. It crept here and surprised everyone on a morning last week: when people wake up, they saw everything around covered with frost and when they stepped out of their houses they were hit by the evil icy blows. And it seems the frigid weather likes Hungary and is willing to stay here for a long time.</p>
<p>As for me I will go to the cinema soon to watch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Critics say it is much better than the first movie, though not perfect yet. Well, I'll see if it meets my expectations.</p>
