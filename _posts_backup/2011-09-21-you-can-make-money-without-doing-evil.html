<p>So I was going to check out a video on YouTube which turned out to be geobanned: <em>Unfortunately this content is not available in your region because the owner has not granted the respective music publishing rights</em>. Bla bla.</p>
<p>All right, I thought, this has happened before. Let's try the phone which is on a non-proxied network. Only I was reluctant to go through the hassle of navigating to the video by hand and tried to look for an easier solution, such as sending a link directly to the Android browser.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to find the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oadboiipflhobonjjffjbfekfjcgkhco">Chrome to Phone</a> extension-app pair which was just what I was looking for. Or so I thought. Because when I tried to install the app on the <a href="http://sesam.hu/2011/07/04/nexus-s">Nexus S</a> I was greeted by the following error message:Â <strong>This item cannot be installed in your device's country.</strong></p>
<p>Really, Google? Where's the much praised Android freedom now?</p>
