  content: "Well, for 40-50k tuition fee per year, you should feel like a customer.
    \r\n\r\nhttp://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/registrar/students/tuition-fees_12-13\r\n\r\nOr
    do you?\r\n\r\nYou could buy connections and opportunities (esp. when you already
    have them), but could you buy knowledge?\r\n\r\nOr from the university's side:
    if students are your customers (=they provide you the operational costs plus profit),
    how can you have a different aim than maximalizing profit?\r\n\r\nI am more happy
    if my professors threat me as a (future) colleague.\r\n\r\n(To be fair the whole
    \"are students customers?\" argument is quiet old, and it really depends on how
    we define \"customers\".)"

  content: "Of course there are two sides of the story, as always.\r\n\r\nMaybe being
    viewed as a customer is not the best but sure hell of a lot better than basically
    being ignored."

<p>Last week Gyula Fehér, the CTO of Ustream, gave a presentation as a guest at a class taught at Stanford University:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nas4UubDMeE" height="459" width="768" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>I have a <em>lot</em> of experience with higher education, may that be good or bad. And—even though I believe this is how students should be viewed—never have I felt like a <em>customer</em> of the organisation providing said education. <em>Especially</em> not in Hungary. It seems one has to travel overseas for this kind of experience. Please note the closing words of the professor teaching this particular class in the video:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I'd like to thank our students, <strong>who are my primary customers here</strong>. I hope this has been interesting, useful, valuable, exciting, good place to make contacts and networks, broaden your horizons a little bit."</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine any professor in any Hungarian institution regarding their students as customers receiving a service?</p>
