<p>WILLOW: <em>I don't know. You've been studying really a lot.</em></p>
<p>BUFFY: <em>I try, but they're already piling on the reading and, of course, Giles is filling in the little corners of free time with extra training. I'm starting to think this working hard is hard work.</em></p>
<p>WILLOW: <em>Isn't it crazy like that?</em></p>
<p>BUFFY: <em>I thought it was gonna be more like in the movies. You know, inspirational music and a montage: me sharpening pencils, reading, writing, falling asleep on a big pile of books with my glasses all crooked because in the montage I have glasses. Real life is so slow and it hurts my occipital lobe.</em></p>
