<p>Today is a special day, as my former English teacher used to start her class in grammar school. It's Women's day today. Get up all males of the world and buy flowers to thank the women that we are here. For all of us was helped to life by a woman and we all seek a woman to complete our lives. Plus females are just terribly cute... :) </p>
<p>As we haven't already found out how can we transport material on the internet I cannot send flowers or anything on this medium. What I can is text. So here is a part of a {Hindu legend} that - in my opinion - is one of the best definitions of the women. Have a happy day y'all out there!</p>
