<p>Yesterday night was bad. I had the worst two hours on Anarchy Online ever. An argument, heated to the top, exploded and caused a massive internal crisis between clans. This is most regrettable. The main problem is Tarasque, the dragon, and his loot. I saw my friends teasing and hurting each other, clanners turning against clanners.</p>
<p>And my personal problem: net access. My time on the net is over for this month. This is the end. La finita comedia.</p>
<p>These two things pursued me to the decision to leave my newly created organisation Radiant Heart. The leadership was given to Knightsabre a while ago, when it became clear that my limited online time affects the evolution of the clan in a very negative way. But now I left beacuse this way I am useless, incapable of anything. Sadly.</p>
<p>A little happiness: double {Ferrari} winning at the {Hungarian Grand Prix}. I was a Ferrari-fan since I first started to follow the {F1} races at the age of 6. This means Ferrari won the F1 Constructor's Championship too. Well done! :)</p>
