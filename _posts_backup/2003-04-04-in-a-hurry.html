<p>I made a timing mistake in yesterday's post as I didn't update the day when posting. That was corrected.</p>
<p>As for today I will be short and brief because I am writing in the AIESEC office. We are preparing for our annual "spring camp". I am expecting tons of fun there. The only problem is that I cannot attend the Saturday meeting of Velvet, though I very much want to. Anyway... I guess this is it for now, I need to go.</p>
