  content: "Depends on what may you lose, but I would say yes, take the risk. If it
    can mean losing your life (directly), then it is a bit different matter. Otherwise
    it is better standing up after a knockdown - quite painful may it be - than crying
    over not even trying to win.\r\n\r\nSo go for it, and win everything! :-)"

<p>Say there was a situation with two choices. One would be to remain in a state of low satisfaction but also limited suffering, a safe bet. However, as a second option, one could go for the ultimate prize as well. The drawback? Doing so a good chance of a total fiasco would also arise. Would you risk everything to gain everything?</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the conundrum the value of uncertainty factor on all input data is inherently high.</p>
