<p>Whenever I visit the cemetery where my granddad is buried I think of all the space needed for the gravestones and the pointlessness of the huge mausoleums some families build for themselves. I really don't think people need such mementos in order to be remembered. I'd much rather be cremated and thrown into the wind or a river than lie in a coffin.</p>
<p>It's probably old news but I've just stumbled upon a project of Spansih designer <a href="http://www.martinazua.com/eng/begin">Martín Azúa</a>: he created a special urn called <a href="http://www.martinazua.com/eng/design-nature/bios-urn">Bios Urn</a> from natural materials which turns people's ashes into trees. An awesome idea. After all, who wouldn't want to be a tree in a second life? You can even choose what kind.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Bios Urn</strong></p>
<p>The Bios Urn project reintroduces the human being to the natural circle of life. It is the profaine ritual of regeneration and the return to nature. Bios is a mortuary urn made from biodegradable materials: coconut shell, compacted peat and cellulose. Inside it contains the seed of a tree. Once the urn is planted, the seed germinates and begins to grow. The seed can be changed for a different type of seed or plant more adequate to the chosen planting place, if need be.</p>
