  content: I'm gonna keep this short and sweet as I don't want to lecture anyone or
    argue w how people feel (even though I disagree w most of your points). You're
    my favourite on twitter. Take care and don't turn what I've just said into something
    negative about you.

<p>I've learned several things over the course of the week.</p>
<p>For example that I should probably print out cards containing a brief synopsis of what happened with me in Japan and why I'm home. It'd be a lot less embarrassing/painful to hand those out rather then retell and relive countless times.</p>
<p>That people still assume studying abroad is without a price to pay. Something like being a student in Hungary, except a lot better.</p>
<p>That I can't tell what I'm planning to do now because - frankly - I have no idea either.</p>
<p>That I still have the emotional maturity and social skills of a Hollywood teen comedy protagonist - you know the one that makes all the stupid mistakes and behaves like a moron. Only in real life there's no happy ending at some airport.</p>
<p>And finally that people really don't change: once a flop, always a flop.</p>
