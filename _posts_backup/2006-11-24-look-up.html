<p>As the title says: look up. The most recent feature I added is a last played song ticker. Very nifty thing, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a> (Asynchronous JavaScript and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>): a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> automatically refreshes the ticker every two minutes from <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a>'s XML. (It is actually far from trivial to embed XML into HTML.) The original idea - again - is <a href="http://sld.interhost.hu">sLD</a>'s using the <a href="http://leflo.de/projects/scrobbler">Scrobbler</a> WordPress addon.</p>
<p>The hard part was making the ticker look the same on all browsers. I tried countless positioning methods in CSS all of which worked in both Firefox and Safari but none in Internet Explorer. (I don't even *have* a machine to run IE on...) It should be OK now, but one can never know; if you experience any glitch or misalignment in the website structure please leave a comment or email me. (Try shift-reload / shift-F5 first, please.) And I'm sorry about the inconvenience caused by the testing. I think for the last couple of hours the main page was literally falling apart...</p>
