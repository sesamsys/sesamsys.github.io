<p>Just a fast post before I leave for the train. The things I whined about last time are mostly done. ;) And I managed to reach 152 in AO as well, in addition to participating in 3 Tara raids. So successfulness shined over my weekend. Not to mention the very interesting conversation I had with Salvaes - a fellow nanomage adventurer - while waiting for Tarasque to spawn.</p>
<p>And now next week awaits me with many challanges, including a Communication exam. May the force be with me!</p>
