<p>Received the email below today - allegedly from Apple:</p>
<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20081102-db5k9fgy1fkgn44e8ntqi854yq.jpg" alt="mobile me phishing" /></p>
<p>Not a good fake. For one Apple would never leave a typo in the subject or use full caps for that matter. Checking the source there are a number of clues as well. The from email address is forgeable by a three year old so I leave it at that.</p>

<p>No emails from Apple are encoded in Windows-1251, nor do they use Outlook Express to send automated mails. <a href="http://www.fwspcorp.com">Fort Wayne Structural Products Corporation</a> is either a fake as well, or one of their computer acts as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_computer">zombie</a> for sending out phishing emails. Definitely not from Apple though.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">Educate yourselves about phishing</a> not to fall victim to such scams. <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2080">MobileMe has a page to help as well</a>.</p>
