<p>Japanese finance minister Shoichi Nakagawa at a news conference in Rome:</p>
<p>[youtube width="600" height="368"]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWLeWqPOFpU[/youtube]</p>
<p>He <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7892653.stm">denies being drunk</a> and blames cold medicine. He does look bored, very sleepy and unfocused. Knowing the Japanese I'd say he was probably drunk. Nevertheless I've seen worse: on official events there is usually someone flat out sleeping in the front row. Of course this particular individual happens to represent one of the largest economies in the world...</p>
