<p>I should have suspected this when I saw the service truck stop in front of the block.</p>
<p>Before a new tenant moves in the apartments are usually refurbished. Mostly just the wallpaper changed but sometimes more. So now all morning I've been listening to holes being drilled, nails being hammered and wooden planks being sawed. Of course, what better time to do construction work than a Saturday morning.</p>
<p>This commitment to work the Japanese have can prove pretty annoying.</p>
