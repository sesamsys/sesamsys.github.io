<p>Still here, posting. Not about the Sziget yet. Have to work on that laziness first...</p>
<p>But you get a preview of sorts. This photo of me at the HammerWorld Stage wouldn't have worked at a higher resolution anyway, it's way too blurry. Yes, that's a Nightwish - Once tee.</p>

<p>In other news: the mosquitos - laughing in the face of the chemicals they were supposed to die of - are happily increasing in number and they're bolder than ever. The simple process of getting into the car is now an extreme sport: I can't open and close the door without a dozen of them getting in.</p>
<p>BH went home yesterday. I almost died during a laughable 3k run again - really have to work on that stamina. The stupidity of people doesn't cease to amaze me in WoW. And parents are coming back from their UK/Paris trip tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sleep now.</p>
