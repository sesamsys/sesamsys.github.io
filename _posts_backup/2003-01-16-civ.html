<p>Gah! I guess I have the wrong name. If I had a family name starting with a letter from the start of the ABC I might not have such surprises waiting for me that today happened.</p>
<p>I have a history of civilisations exam scheduled for today at twelve o'clock. However when I entered the exam room I saw a message on the board that people with names from A to K start at 12:00 and all others at 13:00. Grrr... What I hate in this university most is that they don't inform students at all or only at the one before last minute. Annoying.</p>
<p>Anyway, cross your fingers...</p>
