    i listened to that last week. system of a down - soldier side.

    it's "maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life" actually, though. :P

    and i agree. especially since you're and your are even pronounced differently.

    Ha! You're right. Fixed. I was so strung out on the you're-your thing I didn't even notice...

    I guess some people post lyrics they figured from listening (badly) ...

    Bonus goes to you. :D

<p>Okay, <a href="http://www.mindquirk.com/harmonic.htm">Harmonic</a> is a great widget for the Mac. It downloads the lyrics for the music <strong>you're</strong> listening to in iTunes. Quite nice, since it passes it right to iTunes and it gets saved with the song. Next time you plug <strong>your</strong> iPod in it even gets transferred to that as well. Now, what's the problem? Stupid people. Seriously, how bloody hard is it to get right... especially for a native speaker:</p>
<p align="center"><span style="font-size:40pt; font-face:bold; font-family:Verdana;">YOUR â‰  YOU'RE</span></p>
<p>For the uninitiated, let me do the honours: <strong>your</strong> is a <em>personal pronoun</em> denoting <em>possession</em>; <strong>you're</strong> is a contraction of <em>you are</em>.</p>
<p>It makes my brain bleed to read lyrics like this:<br />
<em>"Maybe your a sinner into your alternate life, ..."</em><br />
(For a bonus you can tell me the title of the song the line's from. Google is cheating.)</p>
<p>If people decide to share the lyrics of a song and post it to a site (all lyrics sites have private contributor sources) how on Earth can they be so terribly ignorant as to make basic mistakes like this? How can they not care about what they put out for everyone to see? Aren't they fans? It truly boggles the mind.</p>
<p>Please, God, make them stop butchering the language...</p>
