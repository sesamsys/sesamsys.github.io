  content: A Szigeten legalább nem volt (annyi) szúnyog. Amúgy nézz utána nincs-e
    valami olcsó, házilag is használható szúnyogirtó -- szerintem lesz.

<p>I found out that blogging is a lonely occupation. I mean ever since I arrived home I'm constantly surrounded by people, and - as you can see - I haven't gotten around to write.</p>
<p>Also my parents are in the UK, so it's my brother and I who have to take care of the house. The main issue being the scorching sun and its effect on plants: our garden has to be watered every morning and evening. And boy is it a big garden... One never notices until one has to pull and tug the hosepipe around the whole thing.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind the gardening however, if it weren't for the throngs of mosquitos. A splash of water to any bushy plant released an angry cloud of bloodsuckers. I had poor BH pick the remainder of the peas and as soon as she disappeared behind the fence of towering corns all I could hear was very innovative and perpetual swearing. (I did some watering this morning, the bastards are still there, and in bigger numbers than ever.)</p>
<p>There was some airplane circling around, supposedly killing the mosquitos, but it proved to be as useful as a screen-door on a submarine.</p>
<p>We've also been to the Sziget. Pictures incoming.</p>
