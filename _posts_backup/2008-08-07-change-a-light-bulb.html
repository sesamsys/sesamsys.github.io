<p>Ever since I started using Nike+ I wanted to have a way to share my statistics. It was all good that I could see my own data, but nothing's more motivating than the watchful eyes of sesam.hu readers after all. Back in the day there was no such option: only registered Nike+ users could see some basic statistics, nothing more. But now - as I'm sure you all noticed the bright orange thing to the right - here comes the new widget. Which is nice and shiny, albeit malfunctioning most of the time. If you only see NaNs (not a number), don't worry, it's the widget that's broken. I can't do much else than wait for a fix, it's out of my hands. And then god help me, because I can't really slack as much as I did before...</p>
