<p><a href="http://jointheraid.com/site">The Raid</a> looks like a really interesting project I just found out about: filmmaker Kevin Michael Johnson teamed up with some people from <a href="http://www.tankspot.com">TankSpot</a> to produce a full-length documentary on raiding in <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en">World of Warcraft</a>.</p>
<p>The film is aimed at the general public to let them share - and maybe understand more - the excitement and feeling of this kind of experience. Hopefully it would even help with improving the general image of people who play MMORPGs.</p>
<p>The filming was done in 2010 so the newest expansion, Cataclysm, is not included. The footage has scenes from Icecrown Citadel from back when The Lich King was boss.</p>
<p>For starters I recommend reading through the project's initial <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theraid/the-raid-promo">Kickstarter</a> page. There is also a trailer for the documentary that will premier streamed on 6 August.</p>
