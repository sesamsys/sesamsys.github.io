<p>I'm sick. Some kind of a virus. Symptoms are simple: I feel bad. I wish I could cast Invocation of the Phoenix on myself to heal up completely. Or just let me be Fawkes so that I can light myself up and burn to ashes and reborn renewed. Not to mention the cool look, red feathers and the ability to fly. :) Well, tomorrow I will be better I am sure. Just sleep a little and that is it. Happy Golden Sunday to all.</p>
