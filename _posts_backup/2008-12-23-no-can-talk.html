<blockquote><a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/rss/nn20081223a2.html">English classes face a shakeup</a></p>
<p>A new teaching guideline released Monday calls for high school English classes to be taught primarily in English from the academic year beginning in April 2013.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>However, there is some concern among English teachers about the draft guideline. It is scheduled to be finalized for announcement in February or March.</p>
<p><strong>"This could embarrass particularly older teachers who know grammar well but are not very good at conversation,"</strong> one teacher said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh god, some older language teachers who can't actually speak the language they teach might get embarrassed. We can't have that, no. Who cares if the kids don't learn how to talk. After all, which idiot uses language to converse anyway...</p>
