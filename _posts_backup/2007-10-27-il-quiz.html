    Yeah, I was exploring the wonders of Hungarian criminal law until 4 a.m.

    That's what I was doing.
    That's what I always do.
    That's what I'm gonna start doing now too.

    :(

<p><a href="http://www.opiniojuris.org/posts/1193168003.shtml">Opinio Juris</a> has linked <a href="http://www.funtrivia.com/trivia-quiz/World/International-Law-225157.html">this very short quiz</a> for everyone to test their knowledge in International Law. I got 6/10, but the questions seemed rather easy. So for someone really studying this, it should be an easy ten. (I missed questions 1, 3, 8 and 9.) It's remarkable though that only 27% answered question #7 about <em>ius ad bellum</em> right.</p>
