<div align="center">If someone stood up in a crowd<br />
And raised his voice up way out loud<br />
And waved his arm<br />
And shook his leg<br />
You'd notice him</p>
<p>If someone in a movie show<br />
Yelled "fire in the second row,<br />
This whole place is a powder keg!"<br />
You'd notice him</p>
<p>And even without clucking like a hen<br />
Everyone gets noticed, now and then,<br />
Unless, of course, that person should be<br />
Invisible, inconsequential me!</p>
<p>Cellophane<br />
Mister cellophane<br />
Should have been my name!<br />
Mister cellophane<br />
'cause you can look right through me<br />
Walk right by me<br />
And never know I'm there!</p>
<p>I tell ya<br />
Cellophane<br />
Mister cellophane<br />
Should have been my name<br />
Mister cellophane<br />
'cause you can look right through me walk right by me<br />
And never know I'm there...</p>
<p>Suppose you was a little cat<br />
Residin' in a person's flat<br />
Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?<br />
You'd notice him</p>
<p>Suppose you was a woman wed<br />
And sleepin' in a double bed beside one man for seven years<br />
You'd notice him</p>
<p>A human being's made of more than air<br />
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there</p>
<p>Unless that human bein' next to you<br />
Is unimpressive, undistinguished<br />
You know who...</p>
<p>Should have been my name<br />
Mister cellophane<br />
'cause you can look right through me<br />
Walk right by me<br />
And never know I'm there<br />
I tell ya<br />
Cellophane<br />
Mister cellophane<br />
Should have been my name<br />
Mister cellophane<br />
'cause you can look right through me<br />
Walk right by me<br />
And never know I'm there<br />
Never even know I'm there</p></div>
