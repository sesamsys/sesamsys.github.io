  content: you have to critically reflect on your opinion just in case it's not as
    solid in light of new facts or new situations. if you find that you can't change
    your mind then  it's hard to know what the best thing to do is

  content: An example would give the whole thing away. Nevertheless I will explain
    the situation at an appropriate time. Also, I am quite sure I am right.

<p>Here's a question of morality to you, readers.</p>
<p>Let's say there's an issue you're passionate about, something you have also expressed your opinion about before. Then suddenly you find out that should you stand your ground and defend what you believe it won't be you who suffers, but people that are close to you.</p>
<p>Essentially the conundrum is if you would stick to your beliefs and ideals at the cost of grief and distress caused to your relatives. Or would you just swallow a bitter pill and keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p>Hypothetically of course. Any resemblance to actual situations is purely coincidental.</p>
