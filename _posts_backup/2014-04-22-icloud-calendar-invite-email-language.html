<p>A colleague showed me today the email she got about my Calendar invite: it had been in Japanese.</p>
<p>I've received emails from Apple in Japanese before, for example about password resets, due to the fact that I registered my—then me.com—address while I've been living in Japan. I didn't mind it much. However, in cases like above this behaviour might cause certain problems...</p>
<p>But what sets the language of service emails about Calendar invites or iMessage device activations? Apparently the language setting of the <a href="http://icloud.com" target="_blank">icloud.com</a> website has nothing to do with it. A quick search pointed me to <a href="http://appleid.apple.com" target="_blank">appleid.apple.com</a> and sure enough it had a section called Language and Contact Preferences with the preferred language set to 日本語.</p>
