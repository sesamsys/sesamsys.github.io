<p>I haven't passed my second analysis exam either. Now I have one last chance and then I need to take up this subject again next semester. Which wouldn't make me happy at all. But I am getting upset about this whole fuss as well. However tomorrow I have another exam - for a change. So I'd better not write here but learn some. Cya.</p>
