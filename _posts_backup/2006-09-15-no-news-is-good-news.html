<p>Mostly I'm too tired to work on posts. Without trying to appear big-headed... well, quite hard to explain: when I write about something I strive for excellence. Please, disregard the results for a second. I may or may not achieve anything beyond ordinary / terrible / utterly boring. However there is an idea I always have about each and every post, how it should sound, what it should convey. And to make it so I look up words, read source materials, find webpages, and so on. And it all takes time, determination and motivation which I sometimes don't have after a long day. There are times when I can catch up though and I carefully register all want-to-post moments and events in order to make them real one day.</p>
