<p><b>22 albums, 754 photos on 5 pages</b> greets the viewers of the <a href="http://www.sesam.hu/.gallery">gallery</a> now. The tech guys of <a href="http://www.startlogic.com">Startlogic</a> restored the lost pictures from their backups for me. :D</p>
<p>To celebrate the event I upoloaded two more sets of pictures of old events. You can see how we went to see <a href="http://www.sesam.hu/.gallery/kabuki">Kabuki</a> and a trip to <a href="http://www.sesam.hu/.gallery/kamakura-utsumi">Kamakura</a> with Utsumi Sensei, the Japanese history teacher. I wasn't present at the latter and I wanted to write about the former some, but I don't have the time now.</p>
<p>I still have 3 days to survive at JLC before the summer starts. There is an alarming rate they are giving out homeworks for the summer though. One drawback of the separated classes is that each class's teacher gives homeworks separately resulting in a neat pile of time-killers for the puny one month long vacation.</p>
