<p>I wish I had the luxury of being convinced that I'm mostly right. It allows an enviable stability and peace of mind. However, I tend to ponder over my own actions, evaluate and re-evaluate them, dissect every step, try different viewpoints. The obsessivity of which strikes me as a little unhealthy. It would be awfully convenient to skip over all that rumination and default myself to being infallible. Which seems to be oh so common.</p>
<p>Why can't I have the ability of doubtless evaluation. Better, revelation. Opinion ceases being merely so when it's backed up by the knowledge that it's right. <em>There is no spoon.</em></p>
<p>But please define what's good and worthy; and also who are You to tell?</p>
<p>Guess one has to be born with the ability.</p>
