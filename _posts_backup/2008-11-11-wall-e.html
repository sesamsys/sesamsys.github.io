<p>Oh I know it's so yesterday to rant about how great Wall-E is. This is a little like Firefly that rested on my hard drive unnoticed and mostly forgotten for over a year only to be found and to turn my world upside down.</p>
<p>With Wall-E I was caught from the very beginning with the grandiose shots of mountains of trash and dirt so alike live-action. Later I half-expected the protagonist machine to don a leather jacket and track away into the sun Fallout-like, because La vie en Rose is very similar to A Kiss to Build a Dream On.</p>
<p>And of course any self-respecting geek stifles a joyful yelp when Wall-E's fully charged sound turns out to be the Mac's boot-up chime. Eve's sleek design is also reminiscent of the white iMac, and I learned from the castlist that the evil Autopilot speaks via MacInTalk, OS X's built-in text-to-speech software.</p>
<p>To test I typed "Captain? Captain? Let go!" to TextEdit and had it voiced. It really is the same (with some change of pitch and tone).</p>
<p>Actually laughed out loud at Thus Spoke Zarathustra.</p>
<p>Pure joy.</p>
