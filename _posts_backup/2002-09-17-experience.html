<p>Hm. A bit of a silence for some time I shall say. I had tons of things to do and some unexpected accidents prevented me from updating my website for quite a long time.</p>
<p>First when I moved to Budapest I left the password for the ftp access at home, and no one could retrieve it for me. And when I got home came the shock. I switched the computer on and the Windows Xp started to whine about some file that is corrupted and that I should use the CD to repair it. Well, I found a .sav version of the file and exchenged it hoping that the problem is sloved. Well to my greatest surprise Windows started to reinstall (!) itself on its own... no comment.</p>
<p>Anyway the password of the ftp access was on my computer as well, and - yes you guessed it right - I have lost it during the windows reinstall. Ack. But cheer up, let the sun shine, etc. as I have the password now. (The support of the service provider sent it to me. :) ) So from now on, I am trying to update somehow regularly. (Note that this is not my first later supposedly unfulfilled promise! ;) )</p>
<p>Yehaw, almost forgot the astonishing news: I got a reader mail! (Well not *that* astonishing as my cousin wrote it... ;) The original letter was in Hungarian, the translation is mine.)</p>
<p>'I am just browsing sesam.hu and I am shocked how cool, it is... really, it is very much like you. Congratulations!!!<br />
I like the second picture from above in your bio and the picture took in Greece is cute too. Show them to girls, they will surely be impressed.... ;)'</p>
<p>Errr... thanks really! :) Happy to hear that my site is liked. Homework for you, readers: send as many girls as you know to check my site out! :)</p>
