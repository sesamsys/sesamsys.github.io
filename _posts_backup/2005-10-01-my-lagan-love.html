<p><i>Where Lagan stream sing lullaby<br />
There blows a lily fair<br />
When twilight gleam is in her eyes<br />
The night is on her hair<br />
And like a love - sick lenanshee<br />
She hath my heart in thrall<br />
<b>No life have I, no liberty<br />
With love is lord of all</b></p>
<p>And sometimes when the beetles horn<br />
Hath lulled the eve to sleep<br />
I steal unto her shieling low<br />
And through her dooreen peep<br />
There on the cricket's singing stone<br />
She stirs the bog wood fire<br />
And hums in soft sweet undertones<br />
The song of heart's desire</p>
<p>Her welcome like her love for me<br />
Is from her heart within<br />
Her warm kiss is felicity<br />
That knows no taint of sin</i></p>
