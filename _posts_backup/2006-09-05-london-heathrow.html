<p>Back to <em>my civilisation</em> where wireless Internet costs 5 GBP per hour. T Mobile FTL. Still Heathrow is a good old friend, especially since I almost died of boredom here on the way home last Christmas. Security is quite tight, literally: they frisk everyone at the checkpoint. Also passengers are asked to remove shoes and belts. Luckily no urine sample or blood test... yet.</p>
<p>Sidenote: OK, it's expensive but this wifi is faster than most of wired the accesses we have in Hungary.</p>
<p>(I know this post shouldn't be on the fifth, but it's already 2.00am in Japan and the blog is set to JST.)</p>
