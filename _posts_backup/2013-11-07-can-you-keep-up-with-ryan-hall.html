<p>At first I was like: 4'46"? <a href="http://instagram.com/p/gYeshqzAZa">I can run that fast</a>, granted not for 42.2 kilometres, but maybe a 10k. It just looked much faster than that when people were put on the treadmill. And then I realised, it's <strong>4'46" per mile</strong>.</p>

<p>Which is 2'57" per kilometre.</p>
