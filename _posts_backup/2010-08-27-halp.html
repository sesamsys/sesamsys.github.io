<p>There is something bugging me and my brother and I was wondering if there's anyone out there able to explain.</p>
<p>This is also a bit of a spoiler if you haven't read Audrey Niffenegger's <em>A Time Traveler's Wife</em>, so consider yourself warned.</p>
<p>There's the bit where Henry explains his crimes during his <em>episodes</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"So in order to cope, I pick locks, shoplift, pick pockets, mug people, panhandle, break and enter, steal cars, lie, fold, spindle, and mutilate. You name it, I've done it."</p></blockquote>
<p>Everything else we know except what <strong>fold</strong> and <strong>spindle</strong> mean as crimes. They either have some obscure slang meaning obviously missing from dictionaries or are maybe synonyms for stretching the truth?</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>(If you have the Hungarian translation, what does it say? Book I, Chapter <em>Eat or Be Eaten</em>)</p>
