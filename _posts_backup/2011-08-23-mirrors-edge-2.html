<p>I suppose the moral would be:<strong> nothing is as critical and potentially life-changing as it might seem for the first time</strong>. Need to <a href="http://thisisindexed.com/2011/08/let-yourself-go">let oneself go</a>.</p>
<p>I think I was first really disappointed when I didn't get into the program of my first choice at university. I applied for International Relations and ended up having to major in Economics. This took a considerable amount of time to live down, even though in retrospect it was probably for the better.</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="http://sesam.hu/2009/09/17/sic-transit-gloria-mundi">fiasco</a> in Kobe of not getting enough credits to graduate. It wasn't much fun coming back to Hungary afterwards.</p>
<p>Regardless, I'm <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TERyxFfMqDk">still alive</a>.</p>
