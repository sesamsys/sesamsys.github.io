<p>Hey! Glad to inform you that SeSamhu is alive and kicking. The reason why it was taken down - despite the frightening message and "abuse" email address - is quite simple: overdue payment. I forgot to change the credit card used to pay for the webspace and apparently StartLogic had my old email address as well. Took a couple of emails between me and the tech support to figure that out... Then I was asked to contact the billing department, which proved to be extremely non-responsive and slow.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" id="image734" src="http://sesam.hu/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/gizmo.png" alt="Gizmo" />The Gizmo Project however got me thinking. It's a VoIP service that is able to call landlines and mobile phones all over the world, like Skype. But unlike Skype it's OpenSource and there's a decent version for linux. So, I was thinking, if the support for StartLogic is a free dial number I really should be able to call it with Gizmo. And it worked!</p>
<p>After that it was easy: only took about thirty minutes of listening to jazz waiting music... Oh, and they used the OS X speech engine's voice to do the waiting messages. Crazy but very economic.</p>
<p>Anyway, the site is set for two years, when you should expect another downtime for I'll sure forget to update the billing info again. In Rel's words: "my memory = sieve"</p>
