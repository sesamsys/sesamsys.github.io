<p>Just received to my mailbox: NIN's giving away more <a href="http://www.ninja2009.com">free tracks</a>. This time a five-song sample from the new <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> / <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jane%27s+Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a> US <a href="http://www.ninja2009.com">tour</a> can be downloaded free of charge.</p>

<p>Isn't this a great idea by the way? Providing a few songs surely attracts attention to the tour. The costs - I presume - are minimal since these numbers are already recorded and mastered. The band just needs a site to download from. If I lived in the US this would surely make me want to go to a gig more than any flyer or ad.</p>
