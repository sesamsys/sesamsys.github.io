<p>Don't ask. :) </p>
<p>I was sick in the first place. Nasty flu combined with a sore throat took one week from my life. I am now back at the university where I won't learn at all seemingly. Because of the trip to Japan I cannot start my semester here. I am not afarid of boredom however for I have AIESEC to fill my suddenly acquired free time. </p>
<p>I am about to set sail to the Lake Balaton again to AIESEC Winter National Conference. It'll be four days long. (And there is no net there, consequently no updates either.) </p>
<p>I'm planning to move the whole site to a new service provider because this one can only be payed via postal transfer. Of course I cannot pay from Japan so I need a service provider that can be payed via credit cards preferably online. I am thinking about StartLogic.</p>
