<p>Brief post coming. Just for you to know that I am alive and though many times I was on the verge of posting I didn't do it. I have many exams and as I have to learn for some reason the daily (weekly) routine of posting just seems a compulsory to-do thing as well and therefore unwanted and unpleasant. However I had to fight my conscience every time I didn't post.</p>
<p>So now here is a life sign. As for things happened to me I became 20. I mean 20 years old. I had my birthday on 5th june.</p>
<p>I can barely type as sweat is dripping from my forehead. It is insaenly hot here. Unlikely of this time of the year all temperature records are beaten. Exactly weather that would simply kill half USA if they wouldn't have their air-conditioners which we here don't have.</p>
