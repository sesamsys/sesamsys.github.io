<p>Two days in a row as soon as I set foot outside it started raining. Yesterday I got soaked all suited up and today on my way to work on the bicycle. Now that I arrived it has stopped raining completely. It feels like I have one of those angry personal rain-clouds you can see in animations that follow the protagonist around. Mine is both figurative and - apparently - real.</p>
