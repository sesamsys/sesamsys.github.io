<p>After the always too many straining hours of airplane seat confinement yours truly is finally home. Still a little jetlagged but otherwise fine.</p>
<p>As for why the English: I dislike typing in Hungarian on the MacBook's Japanese keyboard. I'll use one of the home computers to post maybe, but definitely not now. It's something like 6 am. (Remember, jetlag.)</p>
<p>It took some time to set things up of course. The IT systems of the house tend to crumble and degrade exponentially when I'm not around. This time we invested in a SMC Wireless broadband router which we set up quite fast and painlessly with my brother. It worked like a charm and now we have Internet in the toilet even. Literally. You only need a wireless-capable computer and to beat the password out of us. The whole connection is stable like a rock and fast as hell. 幸せ。</p>
<p>With giggling excitement I tried what I've planned out back in Japan. In order to utilise the fast net I have there I got myself an ssh tunnel (thx xea). Using that I can SFTP transfer .torrent files to my machine with <a href="http://cyberduck.ch">Cyberduck</a>. Then <a href="http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no">rtorrent</a> over there automatically starts to download it. The process can be observed and checked through an ssh connection if needed.</p>
