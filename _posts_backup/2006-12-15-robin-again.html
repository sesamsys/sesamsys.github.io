<p>I read <a href="http://cannibalgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/resume.html">Resume</a> like it was for the first time. Something made me forget, or rather I have never realised that - according to Dorothy Parker's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Parker">wiki</a> - this poem is cited by Angelina Jolie in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172493">Girl, Interrupted</a> - a movie I've seen. Maybe because I watched it together with the <abbr title="外国語大学 / Univ. of Foreign Studies">gaidai</abbr> people.</p>
<p>I never regarded the whole movie experience something social: I incline to watch everything alone for the first time. After that it's OK to bring some friends along, but the initial experience should be undisturbed. Anyway when the lights go out and the film starts to roll my existence tends to shift away from this reality. I know many people have a different idea about going to movies so I just don't tell anyone and do it my way. Precaution.</p>
<p>There is no point in doing things superficially.</p>
<p>Some drink to forget, I watch movies.</p>
