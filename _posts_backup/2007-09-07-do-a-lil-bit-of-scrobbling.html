    check this one out if i have some free time, i like diving into long complicated
    scripts.

<p>Eagle-eyed readers might have noticed that the now playing ticker now changed to display last.fm links as well. I really would have switched this option on earlier, but the artist link was bugged in the latest <a href="http://leflo.de/projects/scrobbler">scrobbler add-on for WP</a>.</p>
<p>Turned out the "bug" was really just a minor issue and took <a href="http://sld.interhost.hu/sld">sld</a> about 30 seconds to fix. Here's what you should change in your phpScrobbler.php file, provided that you're using version 2.2.7 of the add-on:</p>
<p align="left"><code>$ret[$i]['artist-url'] = "http://www.last.fm/explore/search.php?q=";</code><br />
should be<br />
<code>$ret[$i]['artist-url'] = "http://www.last.fm/music/";</code><br />
and just comment out the following line<br />
<code>// $ret[$i]['artist-url'] .= "&amp;m=artists";</code></p>
<p>Viol√°, bug fixed, %artist-url% now displays the correct link when used on the configuration panel.</p>
