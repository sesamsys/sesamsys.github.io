<p>As a reply to the last comment, and anyway people have been asking for it, I hereby present thee the <a href="http://sesam.hu/contact">contact</a> page. Actually, b2 used to attach my email to all the posts, something that has been changed in WP. Guess now everyone can satisfy his/her burning desire to write to me.</p>
<p>Who knows which movie's tagline I chose for the title?</p>
