<p>Last.fm's recent decision to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spring+Awakening">change some more musical tags</a> overnight started <a href="http://www.last.fm/forum/21717/_/468939">a heated discussion on their forums</a>. Up until now I mostly tagged my musicals with the artist being the title of the musical. Musicbrainz - and lately to some extent Last.fm - is of the opinion however that the composer should be credited. Which is equally wrong if you ask me, after all isn't the composer a separate id3 tag?</p>
<p>The way I see it the biggest problem is with the id3 tagging. I think it's the remainder of an obsolete format (mp3). It would be a lot better if there were a standardised tagging method, using XML, that all formats could embed from m4a to flac. I see XML as a solution because it doesn't limit the amount of data that can be added. It could even incorporate a plethora of additional information such as if the track in question is a live recording or not, if anyone's guest starring, if it's a cover of a song, etc.</p>
<p>Of course I'm dreaming of some utopia...</p>
