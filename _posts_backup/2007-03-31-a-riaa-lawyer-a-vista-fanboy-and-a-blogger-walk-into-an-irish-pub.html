<p>This morning I was browsing. (Anyone remebers when it used to be called 'surfing'? Back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth and ISDN was every kid's wet dream.) Anyway, browsing, just checking the blogs I usually read and then moving on to their linkeds until I have more tabs than Safari can handle in one row.</p>
<p>One thread started on Yummie, then to '<a href="http://velemenyemvan.freeblog.hu">Ihaveanopinion</a>' with a very <a href="http://velemenyemvan.freeblog.hu/archives/2006/08/10/Hogy_nyer_pert_a_RIAA_bizonyitekok_nelkul">nifty article</a> about the RIAA's legal shenanigans posted in Hungarian. I recommend you to read <a href="http://digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com/2006/08/07/the-riaa-vs-john-doe-a-laypersons-guide-to-filesharing-lawsui">the original</a> though. Diagnose and cure at one place, try <a href="http://velemenyemvan.freeblog.hu/archives/2007/03/30/Not_P2P_G2P">G2P</a> if you are uncomfortable about torrent.</p>
<p>Quite unrelated but in the meantime I learned there's a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7249">new release of the Creative Commons license versioned 3.0</a> with more internationalisation and Debian/MIT compatibility. For Hungary apparently still the 2.5 one is applicable.</p>
<p>I finally got around to change the nonstandard Youtube embeds on SeSam.hu according to <a href="http://yummie.hu/archives/2007/02/23/hogyan-lesz-valid-a-youtube-es-dailymotion-kod-ami-wordpressben-is-jol-mukodik">this post</a> to valid XHTML, too. (Definitely annoying to have your clean code tainted by stupid Youtube.)</p>
<p>The other browsing thread started with a blog I used to read but since it moved there's no RSS feed for it. Laziness or not I like having blogs' RSS in the bookmark bar of Safari under a folder and check them only when they are updated. (It's also a great way to forget the actual addresses. Should something happen to my bookmarks, boy there'll be some creative googling...)</p>
<p>In the end I stopped at <a href="http://macthoughtcrime.blogspot.com">Mac Thought Crime</a>. Lately I'm just plain amused at the Vista Fanboys' Association - a prime example is in <a href="http://macthoughtcrime.blogspot.com/2007/03/george-ou-all-your-gerbils-are-belong.html">all your gerbils are belong to us</a> - I want to pat them on the head and tell them to go back to play with their $240 ... well I wanted to write tinkertoy, but the thing is <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/playskool/tinkertoy">tinkertoy</a> is actually <b>creative</b>.</p>
<p>And finally you're in for a good laugh at the <a href="http://lungbrothers.blogspot.com/2007/03/idea-to-make-millions-n-462b.html">O’ HANLON’S ORIGINAL IRISH SAKE</a> (A Mystic Taste of the Country where Tradition was Born). No, seriously, Japanese would be plain carzy to drink something like that.</p>
