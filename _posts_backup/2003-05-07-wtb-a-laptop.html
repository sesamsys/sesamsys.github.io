<p>I am lazy with updates - as usual. I wish I had a computer here at Budapest too, not only at home. The Salthouse closes at 8PM which really limits its usefulness. I think I would be more balanced if I could soothe myself with some at-night AO or anything that requires a monitor to be viewed.</p>
<p>I am again in a mood when I have many things in my head - too much to tell. I need to do tons of things 75% of which I don't want to and the 25% I really want I cannot do. Posting my thoughts is now in the 75% group. :(</p>
