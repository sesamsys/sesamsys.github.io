<p>As I still haven't found a replacement for the Google Reader feed of what I've been reading, here comes a post. I've kept a few tabs open and—without promising anything—I might opt for regularly putting together posts like this one.</p>
<p>Or, I could say: <a href="https://medium.com/message/that-way-we-re-all-talking-now-49e255037f15" target="_blank">That moment when you finally resort to collecting interesting reads in a blogpost.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A historic parallel? The crazy, long chapter headings in 19th-century novels, which often were also dependent clauses, inviting the reader to imagine the rest of the baroque narrative. “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">In Which Our Protagonist Meets A Dashing Stranger</em>,” McCulloch jokes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then there's this Reddit <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/31k105/just_read_a_couple_chapters_of_fifty_shades_of/cq2e2nn" target="_blank">analysis of a sentence from Fifty Shades of Grey</a>, for people who like grammar.</p>
<blockquote><p>Grammar purists will argue that <em>Pulling off his boxer briefs</em> is a misplaced modifier, since it modifies Christian, not <em>his erection</em>, which comes (pun <strong>definitely </strong>intended) immediately after it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/the-apple-watch/" target="_blank">And an interview with Kevin Lynch</a>, the person at Apple responsible for turning the Apple Watch into a product. How the article ends is perfection.</p>
<blockquote><p>A moment later, he stands up. He has to leave; he owes Dye and Ive an update on something important. In all the time we’ve been talking, he’s never once looked at his phone.</p></blockquote>
