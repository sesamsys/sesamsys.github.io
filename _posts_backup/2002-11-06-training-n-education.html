<p>I am very surprised ho organised I am. :) Managed to write a post yesterday and today as well... amazing. :) I found out other computers at our lab where one can FTP (not all of them are capable :( ) so from now on there is an increasing chance of updating.</p>
<p>My written tests were quite successful (the ones I already know) so I am satisfied. They were not that difficult as I have expected though.</p>
<p>Tomorrow starts the TEACH conference of AIESEC at Balatonber√©ny. So I won't post anything until next Monday (If I'll have time then...). I am looking forward it hoivere much tiring it is. Because as usual AIESEC gatherings are the following: morning, afternoon: education, work, trainings, etc while at night: partying ; sleep: nothing at all ; consequence: total fatigue. Hehe, like I were that rested and fresh now.</p>
