<p>Anyone knows the cell phone number of Mulder or Scully? I have experienced a supernatural phenomena this morning. I set my alarm clock yesterday night and went to sleep. However this morning I woke up at 8:15 (my mathematical analysis seminar started at 8:00) and my alarm clock was turned off. Creepy! Or I might have turned it off half dreaming but is that possible that I cannot remember that at all?</p>
<p>The bad thing is that I am going out tonight so there is a big chance that I will be late tomorrow morning too... c'est la vie :)</p>
