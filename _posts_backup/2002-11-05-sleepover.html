<p>*Yawns* I attended a so called sleepover which had started yesterday and meant a night-long brainstorming and project organising. It was very tiring (AIESEC fellows said I was sleeping at the end however they did not know I only rested my eyes... :)</p>
<p>The other (bigger) problem is, that I have to write a sociology test in an hour. So I'd better stop post-writing and start tuning me up to the challange that awaits...</p>
