<p>Norway, or rather retired geophysicist Bjørn Geirr Harsson wanted to give Finland a mountain for its centennial birthday this year. Mount Halti would have become the highest point of Finland if the project had gone through. Unfortunately, from a legal standpoint it would be quite complex to adjust borders between countries—even willingly—as Norway's PM Erna Solberg indicated in <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/forslag-om-a-gi-en-fjelltopp-i-gave-til-finland/id2516025">her open letter</a>. The very first paragraph of <a href="https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1814-05-17">the constitution</a> defines that the Kingdom of Norway is <em>"indivisible and inalienable"</em>. The effort was <a href="http://www.thelocal.no/20170120/new-film-chronicles-norwegian-effort-to-gift-finland-a-mountain">made into a short film</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Haltijubileum">news can be followed in a Facebook group</a>.</p>
