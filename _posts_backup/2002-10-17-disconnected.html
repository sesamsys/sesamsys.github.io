<p>No update for more than a week. Shame on me. The main reasons are being busy and the lack of computers connected to the net. Still I am trying to do my best and update as much as possible. However the week of half-semester exams is approaching fast. Very fast indeed. This means I have to force myself to sit down and learn statistics, mathematical analysis, law and sociology. Brrr.</p>
<p>Many things happened since last update. We played Diablo 2 through in a weekend with my brother. It was a lot of fun. I watched {xXx} and {Insomnia}. I liked the latter and enjoyed the former. And... well nothing else comes to my mind now.</p>
<p>Hm. Time is killing me again. Have to go. :(</p>
