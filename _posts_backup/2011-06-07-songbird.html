<p>It's weird having this constant thought - much like an unkillable mosquito circling around one's head at night - underlying my every decision, reorganizing my priorities, setting my mood. It comes in waves, sometimes flooding everything, other times just quietly lingering in the back of my head, nevertheless omnipresent.</p>
<p>Reciprocation would have been better.</p>
