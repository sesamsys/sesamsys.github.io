<p>For reasons unknown the traffic lights at the crossing next to where I live stopped working for more than a month now. They're just flashing amber all the time. It instantly reminded me of a social experiment I have read about a while ago where a city decided to turn traffic lights off and let cars navigate following the signs only. A quick search resulted in this video of a small town in England, Portishead, where a lights-off trial happened in 2009.</p>

<p>I regularly use <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NnmN4yV7bXS2" target="_blank">this particular intersection of Népszínház and Nagy Fuvaros streets</a>. As a pedestrian it is definitely faster for me to get across since cars give me the right of way with only very few exceptions. Seemingly <strong>traffic flows much better</strong> and everyone seems not only <strong>more careful</strong> but even <strong>more considerate</strong> towards the others. How much better the experience is is even more apparent in the off-peak hours when cars or pedestrians used to wait for no real reason other than the lights being red.</p>
<p>I doubt that this behaviour is intended, though, and I'm afraid after a while the lights will be fixed.</p>
