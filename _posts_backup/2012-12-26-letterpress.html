<p>Quite dissatisfied with myself for being beaten in a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8">Letterpress</a> game for the first time ever. I'm not quite tolerant when it comes to imperfection and up until now I had a perfect score. Anyway, it was bound to happen sooner or later.</p>
<p>The game itself could use some tweaks though. I've mostly played only one game with each opponent but it would still be nice to be able to check my standing against every player as well as my overall win-loss ratio.</p>
<p>Game Center achievements could be awarded for winning streaks, very long words, close wins, turning the tide, using multiple rare letters, extensive vocabulary or a very quick win. And so on the possibilities go.</p>
<p>Also would like a game with <a href="http://oroszpeter.tumblr.com/post/37361598313/ebben-a-meccsben-az-volt-a-szuper-hogy-a">PÃ©ter Orosz</a>.</p>
