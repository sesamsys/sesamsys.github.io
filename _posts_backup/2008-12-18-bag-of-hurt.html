  content: And then they are surprised when people rather download movies just as
    high quality, just as fast and for free from torrent, without all these limitations.

<p>DRM getting out of hands again: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/11/17/apple-brings-hdcp-to-a-new-aluminum-macbook-near-you">imagine the poor schoolteacher's shock when his new aluminum MacBook refused to play a movie he bought from the iTunes Store</a> because a <em>"a display that is not authorized to play protected movies" </em>was connected.</p>
<p>The technology is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDCP">HDCP</a> - High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection - and its main purpose is to protect digital content traveling through various high definition capable display ports from being copied. In this case it also prevented the teacher from showing a movie to his class on a projector.</p>
<p>Arguably a presentation of a movie to a classroom of kids stretches Fair Use or Private Viewing, and I don't know what the relevant US laws say. But still I think that if any DRM causes this kind of frustration to the rightful owners of the content, then it is flawed, and very much so.</p>
<p>Also if we assume that the exact same thing could happen to anyone who would want to watch a perfectly legally obtained HD movie at home, it's hard to argue that the protection used is effective. (In the teacher's case the Mini DisplayPort - VGA adapter caused the error.) Rightful owners should not be treated like criminals.</p>
<p>Commenters pointed out that the incorporation of the HDCP technology is probably the price Apple had to pay for getting a permission to put BluRay devices in future Macs. Also, since Apple is in the unique position of offering a download-and-carry model with the iTunes Store - meaning the customers will have a fully assembled movie file on their end when buying content - the licensors can play all kinds of hardball games with Apple in exchange for letting their content in.</p>
