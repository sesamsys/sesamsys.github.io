<p>I haven't seen anything like this before:</p>
<p><a href="http://wowhead.com"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110101-fnge8mjj392mm6678je7msfuyq.png" alt="wowhead-ads" /></a></p>
<p>I'm running <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">AdBlock for Chrome</a>. I suppose <a href="http://wowhead.com">Wowhead</a> coders made the site fall back to these default ads when ad blocking software is found. The exact way to do it is way above my head, but it's definitely a very smart way of reminding people that there's more to ads than annoyance.</p>
<p>I'd even whitelist the site if it wasn't Wowhead in the first place that made me install AdBlock: those two huge segments were usually occupied by the most epilepsy-inducing flashing psychedelia of so-called ads the internet could produce.</p>
<p>I didn't care about "free" green card opportunities or browser-based MMOs the least bit.</p>
