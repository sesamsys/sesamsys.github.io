<p>A guildmate in WoW is studying Games Technology, and he had the following questions to choose from for an essay:</p>
<ol>
<li>How come games are still for 14 year old boys of all ages?</li>
<li>How will games ever become art-forms?</li>
<li>Why does society accept sex in movies but not in games?</li>
<li>Why does society accept high definition violence in games but not on TV?</li>
<li>Is it permissable to depict racism/sexism/etc in games?</li>
<li>If games continue to develop into wider genres when and why would you say no to being involved in a development?</li>
</ol>
<p>Quite interesting, huh?</p>
