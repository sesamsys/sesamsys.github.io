<p>This Christmas was freezing indeed. Yesterday at the break of dawn the temperature outside was below minus eighteen degrees Celsius as my mother reported. Luckily I was fast asleep that early because I tend to play AO late at night. ;) But days aren't warmer either: my cheek itched as if it was pinned with little icicles when we were walking towards my grandparent's house from the railway station. (My family has no car.)</p>
<p>Christmas itself was happy, I got tons of presents and it was much of a relief noting that all of my presents were a good choice.</p>
<p>What bothers me though is the period of hard work I am standing before as I will start exams almost in a week now and I still have much to learn. Luckily most of my subjects (Sociology, Mathematical Analysis, Statistics, Law, Civilisation History) are at least a little interesting and that makes learning way easier.</p>
