<p>In advance, I'd just like to show this. <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/sesamsys">This</a> is how high the bar was set:</p>
<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100201-kry2n71a6h6a57sc3hs19q3gub.jpg" alt="top_artists_overall" /></p>
<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gathering_(band)">The Gathering</a> while I was in Japan only a few years ago and couldn't stop listening to them. But then Anneke left the band and first there was a lot of silence and uncertainty then the announcement of Silje joining and some new songs posted to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gatheringofficial">MySpace</a>. Which, actually, failed to convince me.</p>
<p>My thoughts were mixed. Somehow the singing voice wasn't distinct or powerful enough. The heavily guitar-driven sound a little mushy. I couldn't pick a favourite song from The West Pole either. I was sticking to the old albums for a while.</p>
<p>Not that all this could stop me from going to <a href="http://www.last.fm/event/1279371+The+West+Pole+-+20th+Anniversary+Tour">their show yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>The warm-up band, Autumn, was okay, but I haven't done my research and didn't know any of the songs. But then The Gathering took the stage and I was reduced to a fanboyish existence. I knew the rest of the band from all the live DVDs, but Silje was a surprise: she almost looked fragile, contrary to what I expected. She was much more likable at barely an arm's length than on the band pictures. (Some people chose seats but I went right up to the stage, first line. Basically I was at Marjolein's feet.)</p>
<p>About half of the songs played were not from The West Pole, rather from previous albums. I knew that they rehearsed old material with Silje but I wasn't expecting this many. No complaints of course, it was beyond belief rocking out to Saturnine.</p>
<p>I'm also not really sure what transformed me... maybe listening to TWP tracks live or Silje's non-studio voice... anyway for one I grew to like new material and I wholeheartedly accepted the lead singer swap. I'm Team Silje now.</p>
<p>Just listen to this:</p>

<p>I disagree with <a href="http://twitter.com/kelt">@kelt</a> that The Gathering only used to be cool five years ago. They are still going strong after twenty years and they are still very cool, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Surprisingly few attended though: the place was only a little more than half full. I wasn't looking back too often, nevertheless I think we, the audience, managed to make up with enthusiasm what we lost with numbers. Time will tell, I hope the lower interest won't prevent or delay a return. I can't speak in anyone else's name but I was left craving for more in the end, even though we got two encore songs (Leaves) not just Travel which was on the setlist.</p>
<p>Probably I was the only person wearing a turtleneck in the history of rock gigs.</p>
