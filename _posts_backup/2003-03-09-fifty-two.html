<p>It's Sunday and here is a short update. As short as Sundays are. Unlike Mondays. Mondays are dark, grey, long and exhausting. Getting up at the crack of dawn, watching as the trees run away from the window of the train, going to classes and stay at the uni late in the evening then go home and fall to the bed and sleep like a log just to wake up next day for the same schedule. Long. 52 words in a sentence.</p>
