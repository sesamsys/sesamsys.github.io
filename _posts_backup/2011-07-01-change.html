<p>I do not think people are able to change, especially after a certain age. It is possible to learn, so I was told, but I am not convinced of that yet either.Â Against my better judgement, for example, I am reluctant to forget and move on. I do not really want to, anyway. Much like a child who does not know better, from time to time I experience little outbursts of lift-me-up hope and that I would be loath to give up.</p>
