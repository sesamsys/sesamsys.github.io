<p>Yesterday wasn't the most successful day of my life for sure. I failed on my European Integration exam. I had two points missing. I am somehow always a little tad under the line... Well the exam itself wasn't to my liking either: it was tricky and unfair. But as I don't have the right to choose I have to put up with the situation as it is, namely that I - though can try to pass this exam another time - can't ever be sure that I pass because of the nature of the questions.</p>
<p>And today comes Act II, another - this time an oral - exam in History of Economics. Sounds 'interestingly challanged', doesn't it? :)</p>
