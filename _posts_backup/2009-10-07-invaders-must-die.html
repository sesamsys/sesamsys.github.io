    Heh. Prejudice everywhere, no matter where you look.
    I mean even you thought it was done against the gyps.
    In your eyes: nationalists = vandalism.
    :/

    I have gypsy and nationalist friends who know eachother, and get along well. Maybe the future starts with such things. Showing people that peace does exist ^^

    The track itself is cool. Never saw the video before, thanks for linking. ^^

<p>I noticed this graffiti on the bikeway that leads downtown. My first thought was that it could be a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136608">District 9</a> reference (even though I haven't seen the movie yet). However I think our neighbourhood is not exactly what you'd expect to be the target audience of an asphalt painted viral marketing message in English. I was quite certain that the sign is rather an expression of xenophobia referring to gypsies or jews done by a nationalist right-wing extremist. Only at home did I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=%22invaders+must+die%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">find out</a> that it's actually the title of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3EIogaEwxY">Prodigy's 2009 album</a>, so the painting was done by a fan most likely. Not so interesting after all... nevertheless:</p>
