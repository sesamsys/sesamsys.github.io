<p><a href="http://english.literotica.com:81/stories/showstory.php?id=256799">How to Appreciate a Man</a> was brought to my attention by Norbi and I found it remarkable. (Don't let the domain fool you, it's not about that.) It is indeed the way male humans operate. And I can heartfeltly agree that just becuse both sides know how something has to be done it shouldn't mean that particular courtesy also has to go unnoticed. It shouldn't be about expecting men to be men. What it should be about is the mutual appreciation of the opposite sex, so that both would feel complete in their functions. (Caveat: the text does include sexual references, proceed at your own risk.)</p>
