<p>Yo! I forgot to mention it last time but I was officially selected to be IT Coordinator at the last LC meeting we held. :)</p>
<p>Plus the translation of {the website of Komaromy Publishing, Inc.} went online. It was me who did the translation.</p>
<p>Nothing else happened to me I think from then, at least not anything significant. I am highly looking forward to Friday when I can play AO. And I have a website to design as well. (Any more info is resticted :) )</p>
