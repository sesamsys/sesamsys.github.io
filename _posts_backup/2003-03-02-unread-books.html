<p>Lately I am getting a little lazy about post-writing. Last week I worked a lot with the AIESEC computers. They needed a total reinstallation and that took a long night to do. And sadly there are still some drivers that need to be searched for. It is really amazing how old and unrecognizable parts are in those machines... </p>
<p>During the weekend I tried to live lightly and recharge my energies for the upcoming week. However I didn't have time to read. I miss reading much as in old times I read a lot and now less and less. The primary cause is the lack of time. When I arrive home in weekdays I am too tired to do anything other than sleeping. In weekends I have my computer and the net to surf, and my family to chat with. </p>
<p>I like reading in a quite place with some snacks and a glass of tea. Quiet can only be reached at home, because in my dormitory there is three of us plus the corridor is always buzzing with noises even late at night. And the pile of unread books by my bed is growing larger and larger as time passes...</p>
