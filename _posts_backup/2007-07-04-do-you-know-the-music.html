    Jim Raynor: Sarah, is that really you?
    Infested Kerrigan: To an extent. I'm far more than I once was, Jim. You shouldn't have come here.
    Jim Raynor: But, the dreams. I dreamed you were still alive, that somehow, you were... calling to me...
    Infested Kerrigan: I was. While I was in the chrysalis, I instinctively reached out to you and Arcturus telephaticly. Apparantly, Arcturus sent Duke here to reclaim me. But that was then, Jim. I am one of the Zerg now, and I like what I am. You can't imagine how this feels.
    Jim Raynor: So? What? Are you goin' to kill me now, darlin'?
    Infested Kerrigan: It is certainly within my power, but you're not a threat to me, Jim. Be smart; leave here now and never seek to confront the Zerg again.
    Jim Raynor: Doesn't look like I have much choice.
