<p>I didn't know some of the articles on Index were translated to English:</p>
<blockquote><p>I worked for the Hungarian National Security Office (NBH) and then for the Constitution Protection Office (AH) between 2000 and 2013. My main areas of expertise were extremism, mainly the far-right and international terrorism, and counter-espionage. The highest-ranking position I reached was executive head of operations, I later became chief adviser to the director general. I currently live abroad as a civilian. — <a href="http://index.hu/belfold/2017/03/21/hungarian_secret_agent_reveals_how_serious_the_russian_threat_is/" target="_blank">Index.hu</a></p></blockquote>
<p>To quote the classic: <em>"the Russians are already in the larder."</em></p>
