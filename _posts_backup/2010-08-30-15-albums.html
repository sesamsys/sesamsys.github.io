<p class="intro">I wasn't poked by anyone, but I'll do it nevertheless. It seemed like a good way to spend fifteen minutes of my life. Here are the rules:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The rules:</strong> Don’t take too long to think about it. Fifteen albums you’ve heard that will always stick with you. List the first fifteen you can recall in no more than fifteen minutes. Tag fifteen friends,including me, because I’m interested in seeing what albums my friends choose. Todo this, go to your Notes tab on your profile page, paste rules in a new note, cast your fifteen picks, and tag people in the note.</p></blockquote>
<p>My list is as follows. These albums have been an important part of my life at one point or another. Not the ones I listened to the most, but certainly a lot. Not necessarily a good representation of what music I like either, but I do or did love these. I'm too lazy to link them all to last.fm.</p>
<p>Epica - The Divine Conspiracy<br />
The Gathering - How To Measure A Planet<br />
The Gathering - Black Light District<br />
Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon<br />
Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here<br />
Ilan Eshkeri - Stardust<br />
The Corrs - Talk On Corners<br />
Evanescence - Fallen<br />
Nightwish - From Wishes To Eternity<br />
Muse - The Resistance<br />
Smash Mouth - Smash Mouth<br />
Hans Zimmer - Gladiator<br />
Green Day - American Idiot<br />
Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin<br />
The Offspring - Americana</p>

<p>I'm not poking anyone either. If you like the idea (meme), make your own and drop a trackback / comment. (It would be interesting to see <a href="http://isolde.hu">Isolde</a>'s or <a href="http://blog.vlaerauko.net">Vale</a>'s list though.) Out of the people I know, <a href="http://sirubia.net/2010/08/26/15-album">Via</a>, <a href="http://worldshots.hu/2010-08/15-album">Kelt</a> and <a href="http://kazal.tumblr.com/post/1008250560/15-albums">Kazal</a> shared theirs.</p>
