For a while now I've been toying with the idea of moving the blog from its current location and leave WordPress behind in the process. The primary reason was costs: my current hosting plan amounts to $120 a year and that's 💰 I can spend elsewhere. Another reason was speed and complexity: for my use case of personal blogging WP started to feel extremely bloated and unnecessarily slow. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) looked like an excellent alternative. (If I remember correctly I've been shown [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) long ago back when I was in Japan but I did not understand the benefits at the time.)

Making the switch did not seem particularly complex. I followed the [Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) guide and the [Step by Step Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/). Ruby I've already had installed but I opted for setting up the latest 3.0.0 version with `rbenv` anyway. However, this broke local testing, apparently because of [this bug](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523), easily fixed by `bundle add webrick`.

Getting the existing 2039 posts into the new system proved to be less straightforward. I tried the [Jekyll Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/) plugin, but as I expected it ran out of memory. The likely issue is that the plugin would try to include the entirety of the `wp-content/uploads` folder as well…

To circumvent this I made a copy of the WordPress database, fired up a local mySQL server and fed the database into it as if I had a locally running WP. Then I used the `jekyll-import` gem to create a dump of the posts converted into Jekyll-compatible html files. Defaults had to be changed because I didn't use categories but I wanted to retain non-ASCII characters: `"clean_entities" = false`. For an unknown reason `"socket"` had to be explicitly set to `nil` for the script to be able to connect. Afterwards it ran perfectly.

{% highlight shell %}
❯ ruby -r rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import";
    JekyllImport::Importers::WordPress.run({
      "dbname"         => "xxxxxxx",
      "user"           => "root",
      "password"       => "",
      "host"           => "localhost",
      "port"           => "3306",
      "socket"         => nil,
      "table_prefix"   => "wp_",
      "site_prefix"    => "",
      "clean_entities" => false,
      "comments"       => true,
      "categories"     => false,
      "tags"           => true,
      "more_excerpt"   => true,
      "more_anchor"    => true,
      "extension"      => "html",
      "status"         => ["publish"]
    })'
{% endhighlight %}

Then came porting the styling over and adding the `jekyll-paginate` plugin. I needed to employ a hack here because of the differing logic. My WordPress setting was to display the newest posts first which meant that the next ten posts on `page2` would be on the `previous` url not on `next` like in Jekyll pagination. Behold the reverse logic:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<nav>
<!-- Pagination links -->
    <div class="pagination">
        {% if paginator.next_page %}
        <a href="{{ paginator.next_page_path }}" class="previous">Older</a>
        {% else %}
        <span class="previous">Older</span>
        {% endif %}
        <span class="page_number ">
        {{ paginator.page }} / {{ paginator.total_pages }}
        </span>
        {% if paginator.previous_page %}
        <a href="{{ paginator.previous_page_path }}" class="next">Newer</a>
        {% else %}
        <span class="next">Newer</span>
        {% endif %}
    </div>
</nav>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

For now this qualifies as an MVP. There are several things not working yet such as commenting, image galleries, tags, video embeds, and so on, which I plan to resolve gradually.
