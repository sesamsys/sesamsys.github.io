<p>The following dialogue took place in the season finale of Joss Whedon's latest show, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135300">Dollhouse</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Ballard:</strong> So this is it, this is where you steal their souls.<br />
<strong> Topher:</strong> Yeah, and then we put 'em in a glass jar with our fireflies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now seriously, how cool is that, providing a witty remark and dissing Fox in one sentence.</p>
<p>(If you need an explanation: It's a reference to how Fox 'stole the souls' of the creators of the cult show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461">Firefly</a> by canceling it only after eleven aired episodes. Now Fox is about to do the same with Dollhouse.)</p>
<p>You can't deny that the man has style.</p>
