I have like a thusand things scheduled forthis weekend and if things continue like this I won't be able to finish half of them. For example I have a written exam in Communication on monday. Well I have to admit that my current knowledge is... leaky. :) And this is only one of the thousand... By the way it just came to my mind what if the university reads my page secretly as well? I'd better keep quiet about these learning issues in the future maybe. ;)

A cause why I couldn't learn today for example was the fact that this morning we went shopping to the town with all my family. I enjoyed it very much, spending some time with my parents and browsing for christmas presents, clothes, etc. It had a real Christmas-time athmosphere with bells and happiness all around.
