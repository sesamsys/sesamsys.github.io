Back from the TEACH conference. :) I enjoyed it very much, and I am planning to write about it a little bit longer. However now - as usual - I have only minutes to write a post as I have a German lesson. Have I mentioned before, that I pretty much hate German? Now I do. I don't like it. I don't like the languages in which I cannot express myself, and German is one of these. on has to learn tons of complex and difficult rules to say even the easiest thing. And not only does the grammar suck but also the words do. They are long, diffcult and very hard to learn. Of course I don't want to offend any German-speakers here, I just want to say that it is extremely hard for me to learn and even more, to speak this language.

I am planning to go home on Wednesday. I am sooo eager to play AO and forget about school stuff a bit. I am also tired because of the exhausting conference-weekend as well.

And now... I must leave to learn... German... *sob*.
