I looked it up and actually you write committee with two t-s. Well, that is a word I always misspell when I am tired.

It is crack of dawn here. Ok, maybe 8:23 is not the crack of dawn for many people but at the moment I feel so. Yesterday we painted a poster for the first-years to invite them to our yearly 'first-year camp' where they can get to know AIESEC. And I am hungry. Lately I had little time to spend on such useless and trivial things like feeding myself. I am off to eat. NOW! Mwhahahahaaaa! :P
