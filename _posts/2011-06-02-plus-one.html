<p>Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/1-button-for-websites-recommend-content.html">unrolled</a> the <a href="http://www.google.com/+1/button/">+1 button</a> for websites to embed. It's pretty easy to implement using <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/index.html">the webmaster page</a>.</p>
<p>Think of it as <strong>a like button for websites</strong>: if you find something cool you can recommend it to your friends who may receive these via their search results, personalizing their searches. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAyUNI3_V2c">More information in the explanation video.</a></p>
<p>Even though it's located on the right sidebar it works on a per address basis: subpages - such as standalone posts - can be plus-oned independently. Additionally, it seems to have none of the horrid performance issues of the Facebook like button.</p>
<p>+1 if you like :]</p>
