Just received to my mailbox: NIN's giving away more [free tracks](http://www.ninja2009.com). This time a five-song sample from the new [Nine Inch Nails](http://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails) / [Jane's Addiction](http://www.last.fm/music/Jane%27s+Addiction) US [tour](http://www.ninja2009.com) can be downloaded free of charge.

Isn't this a great idea by the way? Providing a few songs surely attracts attention to the tour. The costs - I presume - are minimal since these numbers are already recorded and mastered. The band just needs a site to download from. If I lived in the US this would surely make me want to go to a gig more than any flyer or ad.
