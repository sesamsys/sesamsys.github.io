[Say hello to my kids](http://sayhellotomykids.com) is a post-rock / indie band from Belgium. Their single _You've become_ is used by filmmaker Ramon Haindl as a soundtrack for a photo-shoot documentary short.

Their latest EP, _Victims_ , is [free to stream on Bandcamp](http://sayhellotomykids.bandcamp.com) but for sale only on iTunes. Several tracks from their previous two EPs are available to download on Last.fm, though.

Much like [Maybeshewill](http://sesam.hu/2010/03/25/mybshwll), the DIY spirit is important for them as well: during their first two EPs they produced, recorded, mixed and mastered everything themselves.
