<p>Yay, just had a class in English. And what a change it is! The professor even talks very slowly to make it easier for the Japanese to understand, so it is really much less straining than any of my former classes. The progression is therefore comfortably slow and also some of the subjects we cover I'm already familiar with. (The class is about German Law, in case you didn't understand the post title :P) In addition, the professor has a quite nice <a href="http://www.joh-kamp.de/">website</a>, which - although incomplete at points - is nevertheless a big plus in my eyes.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I might get my Internet.</p>
