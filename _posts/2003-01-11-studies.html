<p>I am tired to think, that is the truth. I have thoughts circling around my mind but I am too tired to catch them and put them in words. Sometimes this happens, most likely after learning maths. ;) Apart from learning I didn't do much only played some AO where my little she-fixer and my brother's crat reached the level of 29. Yay.</p>
<p>Remember, that I promised a translation? It is ready since quite a time but I will need to format it and create a downloadable PDF version as well. So expect it after my exam-period.</p>
