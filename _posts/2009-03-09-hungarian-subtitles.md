    I was actually looking for a hungarian subtitle for a movie and it led me to this post.
    Didn't get the subtitle, but wound up with a laugh.

After [Obama's press conference](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/03/AR2009030301936.html) now [our beloved country](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJq9GwxHJQk) appears in [the latest xkcd](http://xkcd.com/553).  
We are famous.

_We find you guilty of closing your torrents as soon as they finish.  
Your sentence is unremovable Hungarian subtitles on everything._
