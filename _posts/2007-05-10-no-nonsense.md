A [half marathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-marathon) is a road running event of 13 miles, 192.5 yards (21,097.5 meters).

The male world record is 58:35, set by Samuel Wanjiru of Kenya on March 17, 2007, in The Hague, The Netherlands.

The female world record is 1:06:44, set by Elana Meyer of South Africa on January 15, 1999, in Tokyo, Japan.

There is still room for improvement. :)
