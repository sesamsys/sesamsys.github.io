<p>Yeah, long silence, but loyal blog readers should already know that I wouldn't just leave the site to the dogs. This time it was my mother and her college friend who "kept me" by visiting my humble abode in Japan. It was a long week with more kilometers travelled than I usually do the whole summer. The feedback was encouraging though, apparently both of them had the time of their lives. (I would too, were I just here for only a week...) Should you be interested, <a href="http://sesam.hu/.gallery/ladiesinjapan">loads of pictures await in the gallery</a>.</p>
