I'm probably hopelessly ignorant since she's been known to be a quarter finalist of a talent show over The Pond but I've just came across her violin / dubstep / shuffle video and it's pure awesome:

I wanted to support [Lindsey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Stirling) for being so talented so I ended up purchasing three of her songs in iTunes. [They are all available in the Hungarian store as well.](http://itunes.apple.com/hu/artist/lindsey-stirling/id403025113) If you still need convincing that it is worth it, browse through [her repertoire on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/lindseystomp).
