<p>There have been several highly unpleasant experiences pouncing on me these past weeks, most of which were totally out of my control to avoid. Also - all hail Monday - they still seem steadily coming.</p>
<p>To make matters different this time is the fact that I know precisely what could instantly evaporate all my worries. However, if I achieve or not this said nirvana is also out of my hands (and - for now - reach).</p>
<p>Regardless: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/">I will never let it go</a>.</p>
