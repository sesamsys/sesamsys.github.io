As the title says: look up. The most recent feature I added is a last played song ticker. Very nifty thing, using [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_\(programming\)) (Asynchronous JavaScript and [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)): a [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) automatically refreshes the ticker every two minutes from [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm)'s XML. (It is actually far from trivial to embed XML into HTML.) The original idea - again - is [sLD](http://sld.interhost.hu)'s using the [Scrobbler](http://leflo.de/projects/scrobbler) WordPress addon.

The hard part was making the ticker look the same on all browsers. I tried countless positioning methods in CSS all of which worked in both Firefox and Safari but none in Internet Explorer. (I don't even *have* a machine to run IE on...) It should be OK now, but one can never know; if you experience any glitch or misalignment in the website structure please leave a comment or email me. (Try shift-reload / shift-F5 first, please.) And I'm sorry about the inconvenience caused by the testing. I think for the last couple of hours the main page was literally falling apart...
