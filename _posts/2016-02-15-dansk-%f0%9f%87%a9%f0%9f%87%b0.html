<p>I'm going to København (again) in a few days so I decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/sesam/status/698532949831110657" target="_blank">try how well I can do on Danish Duolingo</a>. On the placement test I managed to <strong>clear 14 skills</strong> and advance to <strong>level 6</strong>. Most of the time just using Norwegian as an answer was a clear win. A few pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting used to spelling can be tricky but there seem to be "rules" such as a <em>p</em> in Norwegian is often a <em>b</em> in Danish, an<em> e</em> becomes an <em>æ</em>, etc.</li>
<li>It is pretty much cheating, but setting a Danish keyboard on the iPhone corrects spelling on the go.</li>
<li>Also, Duolingo often accepts words when only one letter is different, writing it off as a typo.</li>
<li>Duolingo can be criticised for teaching its own logic, which once you're familiar with can help a lot in solving the problems.</li>
<li>Don't try to say <em>'rødgrød med fløde'</em> to a native.</li>
</ul>
