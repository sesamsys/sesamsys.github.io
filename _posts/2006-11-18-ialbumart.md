Neil [wrote](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2006/11/what-i-did-next.html) " _the problem with blogging is that when things get interesting, you don't get time to write about it_ " And if someone, he knows.

This is not the case with me.

I'm just plain lazy.

Also, I found out today that one can add album artwork himself to iTunes when it's not available for download. A couple of hours well spent googling for album covers in reasonably high resolution for my music.

*prods Firefox* Hey, you shouldn't underline "googling". Since June 2006 [to google](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_\(verb\)) is officially an English verb. Check the latest edition of Oxford English Dictionary or Merriam-Webster.
