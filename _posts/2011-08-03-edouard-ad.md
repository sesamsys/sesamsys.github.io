Not much is shared about this band (guy) and I don't speak French to understand their (his) [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/EdouardAD). Nevertheless I find their (his) electronic music quite funny. Their (his) whole EP is [free to listen & download on Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Edouard+AD/Edouard+AD) and[ Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/edouardad).
