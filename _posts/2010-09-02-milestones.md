Music, again.

There's [this service](http://kastuvas.bullet.lt//lastfm) that lets you make a list of your milestones for your last.fm page, that is the tracks you listened to the 1st, 5000th, 10000th, etc. I never made a point to make a statement with these milestones so they are pretty random. I'm not going to use the list on my sidebar, nevertheless I find it amusing.

  * 1st track: The Veronicas - 4Ever (12 Nov 2006)
  * 5000th track: The Corrs - Runaway (19 Jan 2007)
  * 10000th track: Blackmore's Night - Waiting Just For You (02 Mar 2007)
