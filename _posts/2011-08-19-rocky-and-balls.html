<p>To contradict all the melancholic and sorrowful content of these past... weeks (?), here's a post that is bound to make anyone at least smile a little bit. <strong>There will be cake as well.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://rockyandballs.com">Rocky and Balls</a> are two girls from Leeds who sing sweet ditties about the most mundane things and still manage to be funny. They are also known to bake, watch this:</p>

<p>This May they released a 10-track full-length album titled <a href="http://rockyandballs.bandcamp.com/album/we-like-cake-and-beards-and-stuff">We Like Cake And Beards And Stuff</a> which costs only ₤6 on <a href="http://rockyandballs.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> to own. Alternatively you can listen to the witty lyrics and ukulele here. (If you buy the whole album you get an ultra special otherwise impossible to acquire version of Ke$ha's "Tik Tok" called "Spit Spot".)</p>
