If only to keep the relative regularity, I'm bound to post. Unluckily though, my thoughts are hazy at best. Can't really come up with anything short enough not to fal asleep while writing and yet interesting enough to write about. A weather report will have to suffice: it started to get **hot**. And I mean it... Usually around June comes the rainy season, but this year the weather's acting all weird and we have summer sunshine all over. With the usual humidity, it quite kicks.

Disclaimer: Shameless filler-post. I know, boooring. >:)
