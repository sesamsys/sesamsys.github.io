This was last Saturday:

Somewhat suddenly I found myself in a bicycle tour of the curve of the Danube, North of Budapest. From 9:30 to 22:30 we completed 80 kilometers, had two flat tires, ate [hake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merluccius_merluccius) and ice cream, and generally had an awesome time.
