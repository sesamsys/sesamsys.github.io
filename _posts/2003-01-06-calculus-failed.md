The sun is still shining, and the snow remained. It is cold outside with a nasty icy wind. However from the inside it looks very calm and nice. While going to Budapest I was just staring out of the window of the carriage admiring the snow-covered nature. And at 11:30AM I failed my analysis exam. As a matter of fact the failure is not official yet, as it was a written exam and the results will be available only tomorrow. However I am absolutely positive I failed. I simply didn't solve enough problems to get the sufficient points to pass.

There are two exams in a semester. Both written and worth 50 points. 40 points are to be gathered to pass (from the 2 exams summed up) but neither of the exams can be worse than 15 points. I had 30 points on the first one, but now I am sure in 5 points only... and that is much less than needed.

This is not unique at all: my best friend says he won't have any points at all. I am not alone.
