<p>My last exam was today. I've been doing all sorts of things I've been deprived lately, like sleeping, running (although I did run a few times to clear my head while studying), WoW and updating the Journal as you can see. Expect more frequent and less superficial posts (than the <a href="http://sesam.hu/2008/08/02/im-leet/">1337</a> one). A slight change: I might just decide to write in English for a while. We'll see how it goes, but since I'll be in Hungary for a while and no longer in Japan, the Journal loses its function to keep my friends and family up-to-date with the latest events, it will merely serve as an outlet for my thoughts, an electricÂ <em>pensieve</em>.</p>
<p>If you like that kind of humour you might want to check this new blog <a href="http://futo.blog.hu/">about running with Nike+</a> by Index people and <a href="http://plastik.hu/2008/08/04/a-chesney-hawkes-emlekcsoport-megkezdi-adasat/#comment-43167">Angelday</a>. I was bored with their first video, but I suppose it'd get a little better when/if they actually start doing some workouts.</p>
