Partly due to the [horrid implementation of the stock IMAP mail app on Android](http://sesam.hu/2011/07/04/nexus-s) and partly due to the elegant new look of the web interface you may recall that I made the switch to Gmail a while ago.

After a few days of use I devised the following inbox-zero method:

  * Mail I read and been done with gets archived.
  * Mail that requires some kind of action later gets starred then archived.
  * After processed, starred items are un-starred.



This seems to work well enough so far.

However, the one thing I have issues with is search. I'm spoiled by the MobileMe / Mail.app power-search which indexes everything instantly rendering the use of folders and the like obsolete. Say I am looking for the confirmation email from my hosting provider,[ Laughing Squid](http://sesam.hu/2011/02/16/neveto-tintahal): a quick search pops all messages with these keywords no matter where they are or how long ago I received them. Why would I want to organize mail into folders then? Or, for that matter, stick labels on them.

Enter Gmail: for some reason the search does not find all the emails I want it to find. Maybe it doesn't search in messages received years ago or doesn't index them all, I don't know. Alternatively, something got messed up during the import and some of the emails weren't copied over...

On the desktop I bought [Sparrow](http://sparrowapp.com) because it was made specifically for Gmail. I am yet to test it but I'm afraid it will suffer from the same search problem. One solution would be the shiny new Lion [Mail.app](http://www.apple.com/macosx/apps/#mail) (which indexes everything) but would that be able to use the archive method Gmail prefers with the labels?

On that note I still haven't found a use for labels.
