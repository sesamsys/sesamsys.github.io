I went to see [Kesh](http://sesam.hu/2011/03/26/kesh-zenekar "Kesh Zenekar") at Zöld Pardon yesterday. Unfortunately only before heading out did I realize that the Sony camera was still on the charger only unplugged from the wall socket: as a result the battery was fully drained. At least I assume that was why it happened. It's an old device and the battery is not in the best shape anyway.

Anyway, I was only armed with my [Nexus S](http://sesam.hu/2011/07/04/nexus-s "Nexus S"). No luck with that either: the pictures are either blurred or whitewashed and the soundtrack in the video is unusable; only a distorted cacophony of bass and drums. To an extent the Sony's mic distorts as well, but still handles concerts much better, like when I used it to capture [Tides of Time](http://sesam.hu/2011/04/02/epica-club-202 "Epica \(Club 202\)").

Too bad because Kesh is the most popular search keyword here.

**Update:** My partner-in-crime [Anett](http://twitter.com/zakkantanett) has an iPhone 4, which admittedly makes a much better concert recording equipment. Check out [Mizu live at ZP](http://zakkantanett.blogspot.com/2011/07/filmezunk-az-agyban.html).
