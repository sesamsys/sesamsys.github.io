I read about the installation process of Windows 7 and how the testers praised Microsoft for taking steps in further automatising the process. This reminded me of what my brother told me last weekend. We were playing Warcraft and meanwhile he was installing XP on his desktop. The PC needed a motherboard replacement and he took this opportunity to reinstall XP as well. However, he complained over Skype, compared to OS X there was quite a lot to do during the process: setting the time zone, choosing keyboard layout and language, setting up the network, etc.

Now I know XP is over seven years old now, and I suppose Vista and Windows 7 are much better at this and require less attention. Nevertheless I find it amusing how subjecting someone to OS X changes their view on operating systems and how things should work.
