<p>I do hate FunCom. Notum Wars is soon out and it is damn expensive! I mean not the booster pack itself (20EUR is payable) but the damn hyenas ask 31EUR for the shipping to Hungary! I don't think I should pay 150% of the price of the software itself for the shipping. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>Nothing else except for my anger I guess. I am busy with working (translation) and school stuff.</p>
<p>Out of ideas what to write... work tires the mind without doubt.</p>
