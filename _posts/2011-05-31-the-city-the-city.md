[![The City & The City](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ogpDQ2DaL._SX106_.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6661027-the-city-the-city)[The City & The City](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6661027-the-city-the-city) by [China Miéville](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33918.China_Mi_ville)

My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/169894604)

This book really doesn't hold your hand while reading; quite a bit is up to free interpretation. Also, the use of English is nothing short of exquisite. Sentences are masterfully embedded into one another, often making it a quest to untangle the meaning. What isn't too convincing though is the actual storyline/investigation: the excitement didn't live up to the hype for me.
