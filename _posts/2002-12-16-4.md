Well, I got my very first signature today, that I have completed a subject at the university. It is communication and my closing mark is 4 (good, equivalent to B). Of course it could have been better, but I am satisfied for now, as communication was a realtively easy subject. The more difficult ones are ahead yet. So expect more to come.
