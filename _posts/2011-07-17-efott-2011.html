<p>This year the <a href="http://efott.hu">annual 'convention' of students of higher education</a> - which translates to an outdoor festival really - was held in the town my parents live in. Not attending was out of the question.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the event the performers were almost exclusively Hungarian bands, to which I rarely listen. I just went for the company. Regardless, two performances really came as a surprise.</p>
<p>Firstly, following my brother I ended up at <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/supernem">Supernem</a>. Their energetic pop-punk-rock music had the audience jump by the second song. This gig also proved that with a bit of luck the Nexus S can take semi-decent photos even in such low-light conditions.</p>
<p><a href="http://sesam.hu/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_20110716_213921.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2882" title="Supernem @ EFOTT 2011" src="http://sesam.hu/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_20110716_213921-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a></p>
<p>Secondly, locally famous they might be, I haven't cared much for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/quimby">Quimby</a> before. However, they were pretty amazing live. Thanks to radio stations I knew about two-thirds of the songs but even the rest had something extra to them: a jazz-interlude or megaphone-vocals, etc. One may not like these musicians but it would be silly to question their professionalism.</p>
<p>I couldn't find one, so I set up <a href="http://www.last.fm/festival/2000868+EFOTT">a Last.fm event page</a>, post-occurrence.</p>
