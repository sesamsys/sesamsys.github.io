<p>Via <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/03/scary-eyes.html">Neil</a>, emphasis by me:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's worth drawing people's attention to the fact that the f<strong>ree online reading copy of American Gods is now in its last six days online</strong> (it ends 31 March 08). I learned this from an email from Harper Collins, which also told me the latest batch of statistics.<br />
For American Gods:</p>
<p>68,000 unique visitors to the book pages of American Gods</p>
<p>3,000,000 book pages viewed in aggregate</p>
<p>And that the <strong>weekly book sales of American Gods have apparently gone up by 300%</strong>, rather than tumbling into the abyss. (Which is -- the rise, not the tumble -- what I thought would happen. Or at least, what I devoutly hoped would happen.)</p>
<p>The book is up at <a href="http://browseinside.harpercollins.com/index.aspx?isbn13=9780060558123&WT.mc_id=author_AmerGods_FullAccess_022208">This URL, if you're interested, or want to pass it along to a friend</a>.</p></blockquote>
