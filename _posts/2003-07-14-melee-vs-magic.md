As my brother cannot install Neverwinter Nights on his computer I tried the single player campaign alone today. First with my usual class: wizard. However this game is not very friendly towards physically weaker professions as I experienced. The AI being not very smart it is a nightmare to make your pets and familiar do what you want (namely absorb the hits while you send off deadly magic from behind).

Therefore I started a simple warrior and I really enjoyed it! :) Warrors have many special attacks which are not only spectacular but very effective in combat. Being a hack'n'slash fighting machine was such a relief from the misery of being weak.

I wonder if warrors remain cool at the end levels though. In the Baldur's Gate series wizards became demigods over level 20 or so. Well, I will see.
