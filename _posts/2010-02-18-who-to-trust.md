In his latest blog entry Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created Dilbert wrote a bit about [how he ended up making cartoons fo a living](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/knowledge_that_matters). His synopsis reads:

> In summary, the two opinions about your abilities that you should never trust are your own opinions, and the majority's opinions. But if a handful of people who have a good track record of identifying talent think you have something, you just might.

I find this quite insightful, especially where he suggests people should be wary of trusting their own judgment. If anything, I can second that: I am my own worst enemy, a ruthless critique of everything I do, an aggregate of all the negative voices that whisper little discouragements, the judge analyzing my every move in retrospect.

I am yet to find a way to silence this part in me without utilizing excess amounts of alcohol.
