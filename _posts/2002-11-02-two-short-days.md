Played much AO today again. Well I won't play again until about 2 weeks, so it is understandable. However I feel guilty about not spending much time with my family. They see me on weekends only and even then I am sitting at my computer... well, luckily they understand my little addiction.

My yesterday illness flew away, I am fully helathy. I do think I have a relatively good immune system as I am very rarely ill and even if I am it won't last long. Not to mention the fact that I seldomly pick up an infection if sick people are around me. Luckily. :)

Next week an AIESEC conference will be held from Thursday to Sunday so I doubt I will have time to update my journal at all. I hope I can squeeze a little post out at least. ;)
