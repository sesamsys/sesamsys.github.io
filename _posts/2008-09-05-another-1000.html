<p>Not long ago <a href="http://sesam.hu/2008/05/23/az-ezer-ejszaka-bejegyzesei/">I announced the thousandth post on sesam.hu</a>. Now I am <strong>proud to present</strong> another milestone: I recently passed <strong>the 1000 km total ran distance with the Nike+ set</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/v1/html/milestones/print_certif.html?id=1492811361&amp;region=emea&amp;language=euen&amp;locale=euen_eu&amp;dateFormat=YY/MM/DD"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://img.skitch.com/20080904-tirut7wjjgjpmggkxwiffhef4t.jpg" alt="Nike  Milestone" /></a></p>
<p>Considering how long I've been running, it's not that big of a deal. But still it proves that I've been running for a while now and haven't stopped when the Sport Kit was no longer something new and exciting.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I'm far from satisfied. Lately I'm not in the shape I'd like to be. I run out of air even on short distances and gone are the days when I could just run 10-15k without any considerable extra effort. I also gained some weight, which - I suspect - is party the cause of my slowing down and stamina issues.</p>
<p>The only thing I'm sure of is I will not stop. <em>I'm addicted.</em></p>
