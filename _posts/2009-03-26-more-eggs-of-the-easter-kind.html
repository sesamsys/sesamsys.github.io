<p>I am sure this is nothing new to people who scout out for such stuff but a guildie just found out that in the Dalaran sewers' arena circles the later to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> are receiving training from a wizened rat:</p>

<p>If you leveled any character in vanilla WoW I am sure you remember fondly of the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=5149">Darrowshire questline</a>, that started by the ghost of little Pamela Redpath. The inventory icon of her doll must have been the single creepiest drawing in game at that time. Now with the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=4100">Culling of Statholme</a> event in the Caverns of Time you can find the whole Redpath family, all of them alive still, on the second story of the inn. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=30557#comments">Pamela</a> even has the infamous doll on the bed:</p>

<p>While browsing <a href="http://wowhead.com">wowhead.com</a> for links I also stumbled upon this masterpiece; a player named <a href="http://cranius.spaces.live.com">Cranius</a> was so inspired by the Darrowshire questline that he made a music video with an original song telling the tale of the Redpaths. Now seriously, you can claim that most MMO players are mindless addicts, but gems like this video prove that it's not all about wasting time in front of a computer screen... if you ask me.</p>
