What do you think. Did they even _read_ what I wrote?

My inquiry:

> Hello!
> 
> I am using WordPess on my webspace. At the bottom of the page I had a function to show the latest 10 posts. However (ever since the migration took place) the posts shown are really old ones.
> 
> I researched the issue, and found the following explanation on the wordpress forums:  
>  <http://wordpress.org/support/topic/152353>
> 
> "Meanwhile, tell your host that they need to upgrade to at least MySQL version 5.0.52, because 5.0.50 and 51 have a bug that causes this problem:  
>  <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32202>
> 
> If your host wants more information, tell them to come here and ask. We'll tell them all about it."
> 
> Could you please look into the issue? (I have MYSQL 5.0.45 according to vdeck, but the bug is there nevertheless.)

> We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. Currently, we are offering the MySql version 5.0.45. The version 5.0.50 will be upgraded in the nearer future. However, there is no any mean time when this will be upgraded. If this version does not suit you can use our WordPress application which is available in the InstallCentral.

  1. The MySQL she said they'd upgrade to _sometime_ is still the buggy one.
  2. The WordPress installation has _nothing_ to do with this...
  3. The WP they have in their so-called InstallCentral is old like hell.
