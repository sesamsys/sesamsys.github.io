I really only seem to have time for music posts.

[Trinity Orchestra](http://www.trinityorchestra.com) is the only fully student run orchestra in Ireland. In this video they are playing Daft Punk's album _Discovery_ in Trinity College Dublin's Exam Hall. First of all, let the sheer awesomeness sweep over you: the many instruments, the arrangement and the enthusiastic musicians. Secondly, how great is that study hall of theirs?
