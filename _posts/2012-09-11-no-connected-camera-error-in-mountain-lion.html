<p>Quite annoyingly after the computer goes to sleep and wakes up again, some applications have trouble recognising the built-in camera. Up until now I resorted to rebooting the Air, which is not that a big deal when you have an SSD, but still I wished I didn't have to. <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4158054">Turns out</a> there is an easier solution: an application called <strong>VDCAssistant</strong> is reserving the camera in these cases, which is safe to be killed either from the Activity Monitor or by issuing:</p>
<p><code>sudo killall VDCAssistant</code></p>
