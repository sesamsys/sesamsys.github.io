<p>The rector of my alma mater had to send a letter to the students and staff today to react to the <a href="http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20110504-a-felsooktatas-atalakitasarol-szolo-kormanyzati-terv.html">leaked proposal by the under-secretary for education</a> <em>Rózsa Hoffmann</em> according to which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvinus_University_of_Budapest">Corvinus University</a> may be closed, its faculties broken up and merged with four other universities.</p>
<p>Rector <em>Tamás Mészáros</em> wrote that the university has not been contacted or asked to participate in any consultation regarding this plan. He believes that such a decision would be inconsistent with the European values as well as diminish the competitiveness of Hungary. The popularity, achievements and international recognition of the university are values to be improved not destroyed.</p>
<p>Corvinus University is currently ranked 62<sup>nd</sup> in the <a href="http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/corvinus-university#masters-in-management">Financial Times European Masters in Management rankings</a>.</p>
