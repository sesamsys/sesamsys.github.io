    "Nevertheless, I think all the boys secretly loved Arkana and wanted a hand-mounted harpoon gun like the one Spartacus had."

    So true, so true :D

    I can't remember much of the story, but I liked it. Good old times :)

<p>When I was a little boy I think I saw these animated series a million times. I can't really put a  year to it, but it wasn't during the original Hungarian TV airing of the late eighties for sure, yet I am fairly certain my brother was still in kindergarten at the time. I must have been around 8-9.</p>
<p>We had it on a video cassette from the local library, and my brother and I just watched it over and over. (He was the really hardcore one though, as soon as he arrived home from kindergarten he sat down on the floor about 1 meter from the TV and goggled at the screen as if glued to it.)</p>
<p>This is the pirates' song and the enchanting intro sequence of the Hungarian version.</p>

<p>I remember the story was quite hard to understand at times. This is not one of those dumbed down action animations you get to see on TV nowadays. Rather a full blown sci-fi with long lost civilisations, underground cities, forbidden museums, artificial suns. And with the music of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Cosma">Vladimir Cosma</a> the series were pretty scary at times. Nevertheless, I think all the boys secretly loved Arkana and wanted a hand-mounted harpoon gun like the one Spartacus had.</p>
<p>Someone commented on Youtube that there is going to be - or already is - a DVD with the original dubbing. And that Minimax screened the series a few times not long ago. For me the very first episode had to suffice. It's on youtube in three parts: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLVGSEWE36Y">1</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1pi2DL7VKc">2</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNY_hEniOqU">3</a>.</p>
<p>Back then they knew how to make good stuff for children.</p>
