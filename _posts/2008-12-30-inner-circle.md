It's weird not to be home for Christmas and New Year's Eve. These really only mean anything if you are around people. And if we assess the situation honestly, my only acquaintances are online.

Obviously trees are not in fashion here, and why would I want one for just me. After watching a bit on a webcast how my family was decorating the tree at home, I mostly slept through the celebrations.

Now I'm undecided what to do for New Year's. The Japanese custom is to visit a shrine. For instance Kyoto is unbelievably overcrowded this time of the year. But I'm not sure I want to be a "stranger by himself" among a host of people.
