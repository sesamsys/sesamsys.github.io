In preparation of the impending epidemic I watched Children of Men yesterday to get into the proper post-apocalyptic mood. I'm not sure the sheer awesomeness of the movie registered during the first viewing. Take the reference below as an example:

It's also very important to mention that almost every shot in the movie contains some kind of animal, usually a dog. Symbolism galore.

As for the Swine Flu status, not much to report. There aren't less people in the streets, but the ratio of face-masked pedestrians has dramatically increased. Almost all public workers - such as shop assistants, bus drivers, postal workers, etc. - wear masks as well. Yesterday evening the neighborhood Lawson convenience store informed shoppers that it was out of stock for masks. (I just went to buy Coke.) [Reuters now reports more than a hundred people confirmed as infected in Japan](http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-SwineFlu/idUSTRE54F1WL20090518), a number I'm not sure I believe. No zombies have been spotted yet.
