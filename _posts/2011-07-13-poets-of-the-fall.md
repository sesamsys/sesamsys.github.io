This one came from my newest last.fm-ified friend, [Midnite](http://www.last.fm/user/MidniteMage). [Poets of the Fall](http://www.last.fm/music/Poets+of+the+Fall) play really pleasant alternative rock and are from Finland. Their single [Late Goodbye](http://www.last.fm/music/Poets+of+the+Fall/_/Late+Goodbye) appeared in Max Payne 2 as the title song. Check out _Maybe Tomorrow is a Better Day_ from _Carnival of Rust_.

I was told to see them live one has to travel North, because they won't do gigs elsewhere other than Scandinavia and Russia. Prepare your [ushankas](http://sesam.hu/2010/12/18/usanka-meno).
