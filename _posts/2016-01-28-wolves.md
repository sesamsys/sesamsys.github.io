[Ulver](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulver_\(band\)) ("wolves") is a Norwegian experimental band I'm extremely glad [to have found](https://twitter.com/brainoiz/status/691654019421466624).

Their latest release is _ATGCLVLSSCAP_ , a completely instrumental and partly improv album. I have first listened to it during a run in the gloomy, cold forest â€” exactly where the soundscape belongs.

Some of the songs reminded me of The Gathering, especially How To Measure A Planet.
