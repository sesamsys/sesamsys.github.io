    can mean losing your life (directly), then it is a bit different matter. Otherwise
    it is better standing up after a knockdown - quite painful may it be - than crying
    over not even trying to win.\r\n\r\nSo go for it, and win everything! :-)"

Say there was a situation with two choices. One would be to remain in a state of low satisfaction but also limited suffering, a safe bet. However, as a second option, one could go for the ultimate prize as well. The drawback? Doing so a good chance of a total fiasco would also arise. Would you risk everything to gain everything?

Due to the nature of the conundrum the value of uncertainty factor on all input data is inherently high.
