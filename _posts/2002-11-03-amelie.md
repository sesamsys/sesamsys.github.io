Hm. I think it will be tough to express myself in English. I started to watch Amelie today. however I had to abandon it because I need to pack and catch my train as usual on Sundays. I hate stopping to see films without seeing the end. A film incomplete leaves an empty space in one's thoughts. And the atmosphere of this movie is so catching that one can hardly return to the 'real world'. I read on Ragnar's journal that this film must be seen in French. I now totally agree that. I didn't like French ever, but I have to admit that it has charms, it has music.

Well, I have to see this film in complete soon. I am curious.
