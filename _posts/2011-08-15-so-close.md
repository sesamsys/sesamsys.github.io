There have been several highly unpleasant experiences pouncing on me these past weeks, most of which were totally out of my control to avoid. Also - all hail Monday - they still seem steadily coming.

To make matters different this time is the fact that I know precisely what could instantly evaporate all my worries. However, if I achieve or not this said nirvana is also out of my hands (and - for now - reach).

Regardless: [I will never let it go](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260).
