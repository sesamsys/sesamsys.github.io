I'm sure everyone listened to the commencement address by Steve Jobs at Stanford in 2005, at least after he passed away and it was going viral. This one is different, because this is for the [University of Arts](http://www.uarts.edu) in Philadelphia, by [Neil Gaiman](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2012/05/trust-me-im-doctor-honorary-of-fine.html).
