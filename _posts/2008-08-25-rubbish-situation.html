<p>Apparently I was wrong. I saw my mother today with a yellow plastic bag, which turned out to be for used papers. Apparently our waste disposal company started to distribute these bags for selective collection of materials. We also received a calendar that lists the days on which the trucks pick up the plastic bags of the specific colours.</p>
<p>Looks like my woes about the Japanese system weren't justifiable. We're basically adopting their methods after all. Â I suppose I'm simply too lazy and faux rebellious to follow stringent orders as to how to dispose of rubbish...</p>
