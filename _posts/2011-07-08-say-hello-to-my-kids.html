<p><a href="http://sayhellotomykids.com/">Say hello to my kids</a> is a post-rock / indie band from Belgium. Their single <em>You've become</em> is used by filmmaker Ramon Haindl as a soundtrack for a photo-shoot documentary short.</p>

<p>Their latest EP, <em>Victims</em>, is <a href="http://sayhellotomykids.bandcamp.com/">free to stream on Bandcamp</a> but for sale only on iTunes. Several tracks from their previous two EPs are available to download on Last.fm, though.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="http://sesam.hu/2010/03/25/mybshwll/">Maybeshewill</a>, the DIY spirit is important for them as well: during their first two EPs they produced, recorded, mixed and mastered everything themselves.</p>
