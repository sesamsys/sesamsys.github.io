<p>I went to see <a title="Kesh Zenekar" href="http://sesam.hu/2011/03/26/kesh-zenekar/">Kesh</a> at Zöld Pardon yesterday. Unfortunately only before heading out did I realize that the Sony camera was still on the charger only unplugged from the wall socket: as a result the battery was fully drained. At least I assume that was why it happened. It's an old device and the battery is not in the best shape anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was only armed with my <a title="Nexus S" href="http://sesam.hu/2011/07/04/nexus-s/">Nexus S</a>. No luck with that either: the pictures are either blurred or whitewashed and the soundtrack in the video is unusable; only a distorted cacophony of bass and drums. To an extent the Sony's mic distorts as well, but still handles concerts much better, like when I used it to capture <a title="Epica (Club 202)" href="http://sesam.hu/2011/04/02/epica-club-202/">Tides of Time</a>.</p>
<p>Too bad because Kesh is the most popular search keyword here.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> My partner-in-crime <a href="http://twitter.com/zakkantanett">Anett</a> has an iPhone 4, which admittedly makes a much better concert recording equipment. Check out <a href="http://zakkantanett.blogspot.com/2011/07/filmezunk-az-agyban.html">Mizu live at ZP</a>.</p>
