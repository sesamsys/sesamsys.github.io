Japanese finance minister Shoichi Nakagawa at a news conference in Rome:

He [denies being drunk](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7892653.stm) and blames cold medicine. He does look bored, very sleepy and unfocused. Knowing the Japanese I'd say he was probably drunk. Nevertheless I've seen worse: on official events there is usually someone flat out sleeping in the front row. Of course this particular individual happens to represent one of the largest economies in the world...
