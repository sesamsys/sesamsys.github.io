[The Gathering](http://www.gathering.nl) quite [unexpectedly released](http://twitter.com/#!/theGathering/status/70211108115464193) a [surprise track](http://thegathering.bandcamp.com/track/heroes-for-ghosts) from their upcoming album the title of which is yet to be announced. The song is called [Heroes for Ghosts](http://thegathering.bandcamp.com/track/heroes-for-ghosts) and in exchange for an email address you can download it in any format your heart desires.
