SeSam.hu is now upgraded to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) version 2.7. Apparently [the Make It Worn template](http://sesam.hu/template) works flawlessly with it.

Visitors won't notice much - maybe slight speed improvements - but for me it's a huge change. The revamped admin interface is a pure win. Almost everything is a box: reorganisable, customisable and removable. The whole blogging experience is starting to feel like using a desktop software. It puts in such sharp contrast the times when I used to edit HTML by hand in Notepad for each and every post. And it wasn't even that long ago.

Kudos to the WP team who continue giving this awesome CMS away, absolutely free of charge.
