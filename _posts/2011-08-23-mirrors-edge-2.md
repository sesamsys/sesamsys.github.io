I suppose the moral would be: **nothing is as critical and potentially life-changing as it might seem for the first time**. Need to [let oneself go](http://thisisindexed.com/2011/08/let-yourself-go).

I think I was first really disappointed when I didn't get into the program of my first choice at university. I applied for International Relations and ended up having to major in Economics. This took a considerable amount of time to live down, even though in retrospect it was probably for the better.

Then there was the [fiasco](http://sesam.hu/2009/09/17/sic-transit-gloria-mundi) in Kobe of not getting enough credits to graduate. It wasn't much fun coming back to Hungary afterwards.

Regardless, I'm [still alive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TERyxFfMqDk).
