Rarely do I get music recommendations on Last.fm and those few are mostly self-marketers. Like this time when [Bellerafont](http://www.last.fm/user/Bellerafont) (age 20, from Ukraine), the frontman of [My Personal Murderer](http://www.last.fm/music/My+Personal+Murderer) sent his latest song, [She's Dead](http://www.last.fm/music/My+Personal+Murderer/_/She%27s+Dead). Don't ask why, I haven't been listening to this band ever before.

Regardless, I liked what I heard. All their songs are fascinatingly depressive with lyrics of doom and soft guitar-driven melodies. They [live on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/mpmmusic) instead of having a website and most of their material is [free to download from Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/My+Personal+Murderer/+tracks).

As a bonus here's a video for Danger Dancer (2011):
