    Dear Szilagyi,

    Looks like you forgot to add page navigation (the "prev post/next post" link) on the "Home" page.

    You should call me Peter. :)

    The lack of page navigation on the index page is intentional. (If you're missing the older posts/newer posts links, that is.) That's what the Archives are for.

    Ah, I see Peter ;)

    That's okay for me, then. I just think that it's not "normal" :)

I have finally created [a page for the Make It Worn WordPress template](http://sesam.hu/template). It is now [available for download](http://sesam.hu/download/make-it-worn.rar) and (strictly non-commercial) use. The only changes I made for the release are a slightly better accentuated blockquote style and validation of the code. I hope at least some people would find the template to their liking.
