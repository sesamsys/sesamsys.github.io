Neil [just made available](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2007/12/like-dark-knight-trailer-but-with.html) a forty-second sneak peek into the upcoming Coraline stop-motion movie, which you can download [from here](http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool_Stuff/Video_Clips/Coraline_Sneak_Preview) in a much better QT quality.

However - and I really do hope it's not a problem to do so - I put it on Youtube. I reckoned it'd be a wee bit more accessible this way:
