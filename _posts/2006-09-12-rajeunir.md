I've been neglecting the blog again for the better part of last week. Didn't really feel like posting, and also not much happened worth mentioning. Sometimes I really wonder how I managed to fill my posts before the scholarship - I am doing pretty much what everyone else does. Although even in Japan I guess the only couriosity is the fact that I'm there, and that can get boring quite fast too.

My excuse for the English this time is the lack of long "i" on the Japanese Mac keyboard. I just can't type it, even after trying all the possible combos and shortcuts. Eventually I will get back to Hungarian - that's the plan at least. When I can't tell. I received no hate mail or whinging comments up until now for this semi-permanent switch though.
