**Help[SFportal](http://sfportal.hu) win HUF 1 million on a tender by Budapest Bank to be able to enjoy the works of contemporary Hungarian science fiction authors translated to English.**

Their aim is to organize an anthology of short stories and select a novel then have them translated into English and publish both on Amazon.com as an ebook. Any future income from the sale of these ebooks would be used to fund more translations.

If you believe this is a noble goal[ help them win by voting for them on Facebook](http://bit.ly/valoravalto-sfportal). (The tender runs under the name of SFportal editor-in-chief, Jun Miyazaki.) The system allows one vote per person per day so remember to vote every day until the end of the first round on 5 August.
