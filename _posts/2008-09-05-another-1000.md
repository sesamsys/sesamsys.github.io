Not long ago [I announced the thousandth post on sesam.hu](http://sesam.hu/2008/05/23/az-ezer-ejszaka-bejegyzesei). Now I am **proud to present** another milestone: I recently passed **the 1000 km total ran distance with the Nike+ set**.

[![Nike  Milestone](http://img.skitch.com/20080904-tirut7wjjgjpmggkxwiffhef4t.jpg)](http://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/v1/html/milestones/print_certif.html?id=1492811361&region=emea&language=euen&locale=euen_eu&dateFormat=YY/MM/DD)

Considering how long I've been running, it's not that big of a deal. But still it proves that I've been running for a while now and haven't stopped when the Sport Kit was no longer something new and exciting.

Nevertheless I'm far from satisfied. Lately I'm not in the shape I'd like to be. I run out of air even on short distances and gone are the days when I could just run 10-15k without any considerable extra effort. I also gained some weight, which - I suspect - is party the cause of my slowing down and stamina issues.

The only thing I'm sure of is I will not stop. _I'm addicted._
