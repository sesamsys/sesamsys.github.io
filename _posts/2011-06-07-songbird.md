It's weird having this constant thought - much like an unkillable mosquito circling around one's head at night - underlying my every decision, reorganizing my priorities, setting my mood. It comes in waves, sometimes flooding everything, other times just quietly lingering in the back of my head, nevertheless omnipresent.

Reciprocation would have been better.
