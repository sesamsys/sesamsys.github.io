> "In the world of sports there is a zero tolerance policy for cheaters. The gold medals are taken from those who break their wows to gain unfair advantage. This expression is better be learned. There is no exception for lying and fraud. Immediate and strict punishment is to be introduced and executed without compromise in order to adequately achieve deterrence."
