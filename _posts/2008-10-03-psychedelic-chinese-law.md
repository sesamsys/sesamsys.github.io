David was right and Chinese Law class is unbearably boring. It's especially cruel for being the first class in the morning, when people (or at least me) are comatose enough without being sedated by a monotone speech about law philosophy. Nevertheless there was an interesting improvement about five minutes ago, when the class turned into a semi-psychedelic show: the professor's laptop connected to two screens on each side turned on its screensaver, parallel lines in all colours of the rainbow tilting and transforming in random directions. All we miss are some drugs now.
