I don't know why this makes me really angry but it does: in wake of the Paris shootings some fake (or as they like to call themselves, fan) accounts of [Banksy](http://banksy.co.uk) on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook shared a drawing that was originally _pencilled_ by the French illustrator [Lucille Clerc](http://www.lucilleclerc.com/about.html). Her name not mentioned, the art was attributed to the pseudonymous English graffiti artist.

I've seen these unattributed images retweeted and shared by a good number of people I follow and I've read several responses praising Banksy's genius for creating such a powerful image. Online media outlets also hurried to report that the world renown political activist has spoken up about the murders.

Really, did no one stop for a second to fact check?

I don't know, maybe I've just watched too many episodes of Newsroom.

On the topic, [this blogpost by the Hungarian translator Tapsif√ºl](https://tapsiful.wordpress.com/2015/01/08/jesuischarlie/) pretty much sums up what I also believe.
