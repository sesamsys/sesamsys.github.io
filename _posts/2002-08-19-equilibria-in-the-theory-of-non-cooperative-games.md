Post again. In the afternoon I searched for some links I can use for my journal entries. I wanted a link to the real John Nash for the Beautiful Mind entry, so I visited the {official Nobel Prize site}. To my greatest surprise - how could I forget it - in 1994 John Nash got a separated prize "for their pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games" with the Hungarian John Harsanyi! :) I know about Harsanyi, because of the {website} I made (with my friends) about the Hungarian Nobel Prize winners. Sadly Harsanyi got to flee from Hungary at the second world war this is why he got the prize as a US citizen.

Hungary has its beautiful minds too.
