As I still haven't found a replacement for the Google Reader feed of what I've been reading, here comes a post. I've kept a few tabs open and—without promising anything—I might opt for regularly putting together posts like this one.

Or, I could say: [That moment when you finally resort to collecting interesting reads in a blogpost.](https://medium.com/message/that-way-we-re-all-talking-now-49e255037f15)

> A historic parallel? The crazy, long chapter headings in 19th-century novels, which often were also dependent clauses, inviting the reader to imagine the rest of the baroque narrative. “ _In Which Our Protagonist Meets A Dashing Stranger_ ,” McCulloch jokes.

Then there's this Reddit [analysis of a sentence from Fifty Shades of Grey](https://np.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/31k105/just_read_a_couple_chapters_of_fifty_shades_of/cq2e2nn), for people who like grammar.

> Grammar purists will argue that _Pulling off his boxer briefs_ is a misplaced modifier, since it modifies Christian, not _his erection_ , which comes (pun **definitely** intended) immediately after it.

[And an interview with Kevin Lynch](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/the-apple-watch/), the person at Apple responsible for turning the Apple Watch into a product. How the article ends is perfection.

> A moment later, he stands up. He has to leave; he owes Dye and Ive an update on something important. In all the time we’ve been talking, he’s never once looked at his phone.
