<p>Voltam Kobében, felvételit írtam, és lezajlott az interjú is. Be is fogok számolni róla, de nem most. Késő van, és holnap olvasásértés-vizsga. Addig is egy kis olvasnivaló:<br />
Volt egyszer egy fiatal rendező, akit <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000318/">Tim Burtonnek</a> hívtak. 1982-ben megkereste a híres színészt, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/">Vincent Price</a>-t, hogy legyen a narrátora egy rövidfilmjének, a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084868/">Vincent</a>-nek, amit Price örömmel elfogadott. Tim Burton később olyan filmjeivel vált ismertté, mint az Ollókezű Edward, Az álmosvölgy legendája, A majmok bolygója, a Támad a Mars vagy a Batman. (Éremes várni az idei Karcsi és a csokoládégyár című Roald Dahl feldolgozására is.) Íme Vincent verse:<br />
<center><b>The Complete Poem of Vincent</b></p>
<p>Vincent Malloy is seven years old<br />
He's polite and always does as he's told<br />
For a boy his age, he's considerate and nice<br />
But he wants to be just like Vincent Price</p>
<p>He doesn't mind living with his sister, dog, and cats<br />
Though he'd rather share a home with spiders and bats<br />
There he could reflect on the horrors he has invented<br />
and wander dark hallways alone and tormented</p>
<p>Vincent is nice when his aunt comes to see him<br />
But imagines dipping her in wax for his wax museum<br />
He likes to experiment on his dog Abocrombie<br />
In the hopes of creating a horrible zombie<br />
So that he and his horrible zombie dog<br />
could go searching for victims in the London fog</p>
<p>His thoughts aren't only of ghoulish crime<br />
He likes to paint and read to pass some of the time<br />
While other kids read books like "Go Jane Go"<br />
Vincent's favorite author is Edgar Allan Poe.</p>
<p>One night while reading a gruesome tale<br />
he read a passage that made him turn pale<br />
Such horrible news he could not survive<br />
For his beautiful wife had been buried alive</p>
<p>He dug out her grave to make sure she was dead<br />
Unaware that her grave was his mother's flower bed<br />
His mother sent Vincent off to his room<br />
He knew he'd been banished to the tower of doom<br />
where he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life<br />
alone with the portrait of his beautiful wife.</p>
<p>While alone and insane incased in his doom<br />
Vincent's mother burst suddenly into the room<br />
She said, "If you want, you can go out and play<br />
It's sunny outside and a beautiful day."</p>
<p>Vincent tried to talk but he just couldn't speak<br />
the years of isolation had made him quite weak<br />
So he took out some paper and scrawled with a pen:<br />
"I'm possessed by this house and can never leave it again."</p>
<p>His mother said, "You are NOT possessed and you are NOT almost dead<br />
These games you play are all in your head<br />
You are NOT Vincent Price, you're Vincent Malloy<br />
You're not tormented or insane, you're just a young boy<br />
You're seven years old, and you are my son<br />
I want you to get outside and have some real fun."</p>
<p>Her anger now spent, she walked out through the hall<br />
While Vincent backed slowly against the wall<br />
The room started to sway, to shiver and creak<br />
His horrored insanity had reached its peak<br />
He saw Abocrombie, his zombie slave<br />
and heard his wife call from beyond the grave</p>
<p>She spoke through her coffin and made ghoulish demands<br />
While through cracking walls reached skeleton hands<br />
Every horror in his life that had crept through his dreams<br />
swept his mad laughter to terrified screams</p>
<p>To escape the badness, he reached for the door<br />
but fell limp and lifeless down on the floor<br />
His voice was soft and very slow<br />
As he quoted "The Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe:<br />
"And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br />
Shall be lifted...Nevermore."</center></p>
