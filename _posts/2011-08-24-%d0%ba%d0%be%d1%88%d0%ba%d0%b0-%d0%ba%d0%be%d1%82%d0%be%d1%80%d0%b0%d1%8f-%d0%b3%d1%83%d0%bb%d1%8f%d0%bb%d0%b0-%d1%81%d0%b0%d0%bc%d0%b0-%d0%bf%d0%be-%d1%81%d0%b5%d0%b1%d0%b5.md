I was looking for a full text of [The Cat That Walked by Himself](http://www.boop.org/jan/justso/cat.htm) story by [Rudyard Kipling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling) published in the [Just So Stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_So_Stories) when I stumbled upon a Wikipedia article on this Russian animated film called [The Cat Who Walked by Herself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_Who_Walked_by_Herself). If it's anything like the screenshots suggest, I want to see it.

All because this has been my Facebook about description for a while now:

> "I am not a friend, and I am not a servant. I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are alike to me."
