<p>Funny thing is ever since I got home I'm sneezing incessantly. Apparently the unbearably hot and humid Japanese summer has its perks after all: it soothes my allergy. I got used to not having to blow my nose every other minute, and now I have to admit it's quite annoying. I hope it's just the change in climate and I'll adapt to my new environment soon enough. In the meantime I should remind myself to have a handkerchief on me every time I leave the house...</p>
