<p>I'd be surprised if I won't catch a cold after today; basically all my clothing below the waistline (not covered by the raincoat) is soaking wet. Jeans are not particularly fast to dry out either.</p>
<p>Still, this is nothing compared to my all time greatest rain-soak, which happened on<a href="http://sesam.hu/2005/07/04/japanismeret-101"> the day I tried and finally succeeded in finding my stolen bike</a> in Kobe. That time even my backpack was permeated.</p>
<p>I guess the second best would be the time when I was getting home from class, still in Japan, and it was raining so heavily that the downhill roads turned into little streams of steadily flowing water. At one point I realized that the white stuff on my bare-feet sandals was my own skin, drenched and peeling.</p>
