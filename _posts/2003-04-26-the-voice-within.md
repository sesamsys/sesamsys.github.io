Fast update comes as I couldn't stand the whispering of the still small voice within...

So. Today I am going to the election of the Executive Board of our AIESEC Local Committee. It is quite a big event with many traditions and special enjoyments so I am quite looking forward to it. As for what happened lately I updated the site though it is not visible. I tried to make it better viewed with other browsers not only Internet Explorer as well. In AO I had many struggles wth the new mission system, which - after two emergency pathes - is still not flawless.

Shortly this is it, though I - again - have other thing to tell which I don't have time to. I will need to send an email to the GM of life that a day shall be 27 hours.
