I'm going to København (again) in a few days so I decided to [try how well I can do on Danish Duolingo](https://twitter.com/sesam/status/698532949831110657). On the placement test I managed to **clear 14 skills** and advance to **level 6**. Most of the time just using Norwegian as an answer was a clear win. A few pointers:

  * Getting used to spelling can be tricky but there seem to be "rules" such as a _p_ in Norwegian is often a _b_ in Danish, an _e_ becomes an _æ_ , etc.
  * It is pretty much cheating, but setting a Danish keyboard on the iPhone corrects spelling on the go.
  * Also, Duolingo often accepts words when only one letter is different, writing it off as a typo.
  * Duolingo can be criticised for teaching its own logic, which once you're familiar with can help a lot in solving the problems.
  * Don't try to say _'rødgrød med fløde'_ to a native.
