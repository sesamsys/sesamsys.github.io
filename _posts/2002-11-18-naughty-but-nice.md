At Uni again... Well today I left my monthly mass-transit ticket at home - of course I only noticed it when I was on the underground - meaning I had to walk back and miss today's statistics lecture. Bad thing.

Like Katie Carr, you want to do the right thing, but sometimes you just can't help yourself!

C'mon now, look deep into the window of your soul.

I agree with the above. Its true I always want to do the best and take others feelings into consideration, however sometimes I am unsucessful and look evil. But the two wine idea I liked the most. :)
