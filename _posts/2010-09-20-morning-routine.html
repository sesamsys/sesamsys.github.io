    Huh, nice...
    Happened to me recently, my mother's coffee-maker went wrong. The safety valve broke, but onto a spare part, some is made to need to hunt, turned up under a week. If any would have been "Szarvasi" ones with Hungarian production I would have received a component in a shop promptly. (Magyarország így szeretlek...)
    / off tűzoltók jöttek, vagy csak simán bakelit illatú lett a konyha ?

<p>I don't know what creative genius designed our coffee machine really. The way it works is the following: when the coffee is done the status light at the front darkens, <em>without the machine actually switching off</em>. So it falls upon the user to remember to flip the switch or pull the plug from the socket. Exactly my strong suite...</p>
<p>The parents' machine at least has the decency to keep its light glowing angry red reminding the usually semi-comatose operator that his job is not yet done.</p>
