[2CELLOS](http://www.2cellos.com), a.k.a. _Luka Sulic_ and _Stjepan Hauser_ , [have been mentioned before](http://sesam.hu/2011/05/09/simko-varnagy-mihaly). Last week they uploaded a new video from their upcoming album, a dual cello rendition of AC/DC's Welcome to the Jungle.

The LP is said to come out soon (maybe this week). [The track list looks really interesting.](http://www.2cellos.com/music/2cellos)
