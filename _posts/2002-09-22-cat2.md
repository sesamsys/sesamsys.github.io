Other autumn-signs came up this morning. I noticed, that our cat has grown a much more tight and bigger fur for the upcoming winter. Funny, because he seems to have increased in size due to this. Cats are no doubt amazing creatures. :)

However much I wanted to be or at least seem happy today, I dislike Sundays for the reason that I have to learn German for Monday and have to travel by train back to Budapest. Trains are extremely crowded due to the fact that tons of other students like me go back to uni on Sundays.

I still have work to do. A project for my sociology seminar. *sigh*
