Norway, or rather retired geophysicist Bjørn Geirr Harsson wanted to give Finland a mountain for its centennial birthday this year. Mount Halti would have become the highest point of Finland if the project had gone through. Unfortunately, from a legal standpoint it would be quite complex to adjust borders between countries—even willingly—as Norway's PM Erna Solberg indicated in [her open letter](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/forslag-om-a-gi-en-fjelltopp-i-gave-til-finland/id2516025). The very first paragraph of [the constitution](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1814-05-17) defines that the Kingdom of Norway is _"indivisible and inalienable"_. The effort was [made into a short film](http://www.thelocal.no/20170120/new-film-chronicles-norwegian-effort-to-gift-finland-a-mountain) and [news can be followed in a Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/Haltijubileum).
