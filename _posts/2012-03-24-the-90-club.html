<p>The Vivicittá half-marathon will be held on next Sunday. It's going to be interesting since I didn't have much time to run lately. However, I spend an hour every day riding the bike to work, more than 20km a day. Apples and oranges, of course, but it may help with endurance.</p>
<p>And because there has to be a goal, let it be in writing. The next step would be gaining membership in The 90 Club, which requires a sub-90 minute half-marathon. <a href="http://sesam.hu/2011/04/11/vasarap/">Last year my time was 1:44'</a> and last autumn<a href="http://sesam.hu/2011/11/06/100-perc/"> at another competition I was timed at 1:40'</a>. Ten minutes is a lot, so it probably won't happen anyway.</p>
