This morning I was shuffling towards [Yoshinoya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinoya) peacefully, spacing out to [One of These Days](http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/One+of+These+Days) thumping from my [Sennheiser PX-100](http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-manufacturer/sennheiser/sennheiser-px-100.php)s (very good choice for iPods). I like walking this way, filtering the noise of the crowd by loud music, insulating myself from them.

This was when an old Japanese man crept up behind me - not that much stealth was needed - and shouted in my ears from behind "My meishi!" And he waved his business card in my face. Needless to say it made me jump.

This is still the way some people here think is appropriate to make friends with a zoo animal foreigner.
