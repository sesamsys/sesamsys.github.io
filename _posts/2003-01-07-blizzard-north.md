It has been snowing all the day and the wind blows fiercely. Blizzard is out there and I don't know how will I be able to get to budapest for tomorrow even. Trains have hours of delays. I may spend the night on one of them. I just love weather... What if I had a peaceful and successful exam for once?? ;(
