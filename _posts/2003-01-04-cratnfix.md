Not much to tell today. I learned some maths and played some AO. I have certain fears about the upcoming maths exam, but as pessimistic attitude never helps, I don't say a word. As for AO my brother started a crat (his ever-favourite prof) so I went for a fixer. By the way I am thinking about a page on this site that would contain my characters. Well after exam-period I guess.
