<p>I wholeheartedly agree with<a href="http://doransky.hu/?p=2136"> Doransky's latest post</a>, and with Aristotle:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.</p></blockquote>
<p>One example that instantly comes to my mind is high school and maths. Planning to take an entrance exam we were put in a special group taught by one of the most notoriously strict teachers in the school. With one exception none of us were really special though, not what you'd call a natural born talent.</p>
<p>Classes were spent working from start to finish, no idling was allowed, and we were usually given a tremendous amount of homework. Often we devoted breaks between classes to discussing the solutions or what might come up next. And somehow by our senior year we became quite good. I can't speak for the others but never since then have I felt so confident in my maths knowledge.</p>
<p>It was slow and almost imperceptible, too. I only noticed the effect when my then-girlfriend was doing her homework with me looking over her shoulder: she was at a loss how to solve something really simple whereas I was nonplussed how she couldn't. After all, I knew, I wasn't supposed to be better than her.</p>
<p>Similarly every article or guide about writing starts the same: it's not all about talent, and even talent cannot achieve much without defiant diligence. If you want to be good (or get better at it) write every day, no exception.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I can come up with when asked why I still bother writing here: even if it was only me (or no-one) reading, it's still practice. And in the process, slowly, silently, I may improve.</p>
