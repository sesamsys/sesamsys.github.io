<p>I have a very good, almost unbeatable excuse for not updating in the weekend. (No, bad guess, I am still alive. :) I happaned to be in Graz (Austria). It was great, and there are many things that I want to tell you about my journey... another time. Today I am too exhausted to write long posts, and surely the one about Graz will be a long one. Tomorrow I will move to another dormitory as well. So this is it for today.</p>
