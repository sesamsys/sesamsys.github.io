I have to admit [I like finding Japanese text, signs, etc in movies and TV shows](http://sesam.hu/2008/01/28/how-do-i-loathe-thee-let-me-count-the-ways) and knowing what they mean.

This is in addition to my obsessive hunt for English words and abbreviations unknown to me. (Like do you know what a [scrunchie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrunchie) is?)

Anyway the latest is a pretty simple 大阪 (Osaka) text on a hoodie worn by Rachel (Daneel Harris) on One Tree Hill season 3 episode 12:

![OTH-S03E12-Rachel-Osaka](http://img.skitch.com/20090909-qpkfs49edybud34jr1dx6c8iye.jpg)

I really wonder how these pieces of clothing end up on screen.
