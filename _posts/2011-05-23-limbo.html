<p>It's been very much like a roller-coaster these days. Had I ever tried drugs I'd imagine the highs to be comparable. And the lows, well, I'm no stranger to deep dark ones anyway.</p>
<p>It's all good, though, since were I not experiencing this oscillation of moods I'd complain about the lack of it for sure. It's better to live than vegetate. And this time I won't give up my dreams so easily.</p>
