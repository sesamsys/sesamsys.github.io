A guildmate in WoW is studying Games Technology, and he had the following questions to choose from for an essay:

  1. How come games are still for 14 year old boys of all ages?
  2. How will games ever become art-forms?
  3. Why does society accept sex in movies but not in games?
  4. Why does society accept high definition violence in games but not on TV?
  5. Is it permissable to depict racism/sexism/etc in games?
  6. If games continue to develop into wider genres when and why would you say no to being involved in a development?



Quite interesting, huh?
