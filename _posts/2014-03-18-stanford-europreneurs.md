  content: "Well, for 40-50k tuition fee per year, you should feel like a customer.
    \r\n\r\nhttp://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/registrar/students/tuition-fees_12-13\r\n\r\nOr
    do you?\r\n\r\nYou could buy connections and opportunities (esp. when you already
    have them), but could you buy knowledge?\r\n\r\nOr from the university's side:
    if students are your customers (=they provide you the operational costs plus profit),
    how can you have a different aim than maximalizing profit?\r\n\r\nI am more happy
    if my professors threat me as a (future) colleague.\r\n\r\n(To be fair the whole
    \"are students customers?\" argument is quiet old, and it really depends on how
    we define \"customers\".)"

  content: "Of course there are two sides of the story, as always.\r\n\r\nMaybe being
    viewed as a customer is not the best but sure hell of a lot better than basically
    being ignored."

Last week Gyula Fehér, the CTO of Ustream, gave a presentation as a guest at a class taught at Stanford University:

I have a _lot_ of experience with higher education, may that be good or bad. And—even though I believe this is how students should be viewed—never have I felt like a _customer_ of the organisation providing said education. _Especially_ not in Hungary. It seems one has to travel overseas for this kind of experience. Please note the closing words of the professor teaching this particular class in the video:

> "I'd like to thank our students, **who are my primary customers here**. I hope this has been interesting, useful, valuable, exciting, good place to make contacts and networks, broaden your horizons a little bit."

Can you imagine any professor in any Hungarian institution regarding their students as customers receiving a service?
