It's mostly about waiting. That, and packing the room up in rubbish bags. When I get fed up with the chores I watch an unhealthy amount of TV shows or go for a run. Not knowing doesn't help either. At the moment I wish I'd be going forward or crushed down - anything's better than idling. Ask me in two weeks I'll probably look back in hazy-eyed nostalgia to these days of course.
