<p>This morning I was shuffling towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinoya">Yoshinoya</a> peacefully, spacing out to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/One+of+These+Days">One of These Days</a> thumping from my <a href="http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-manufacturer/sennheiser/sennheiser-px-100.php">Sennheiser PX-100</a>s (very good choice for iPods). I like walking this way, filtering the noise of the crowd by loud music, insulating myself from them.</p>
<p>This was when an old Japanese man crept up behind me - not that much stealth was needed - and shouted in my ears from behind "My meishi!" And he waved his business card in my face. Needless to say it made me jump.</p>
<p>This is still the way some people here think is appropriate to make friends with a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">zoo animal</span> foreigner.</p>
