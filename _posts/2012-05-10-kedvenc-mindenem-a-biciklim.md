I was shown a new route to/from work yesterday evening that takes me through a river island instead of the embankment of the Danube. No traffic or lights, just trees and the occasional jogger for five to ten minutes, depending on how much I want to hurry. Soundtrack by the birds and the pair of Vittoria Rubinos. A much welcome change offering moments of true serenity at a time when it's most needed.
