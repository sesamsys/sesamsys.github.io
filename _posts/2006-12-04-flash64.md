Actually... I still can't see the post below on my Linux desktop. No, it's not Linux that "suxx", it's Adobe. The cheeky bastards still haven't released a 64 bit Flash plugin, and [according to this](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=6b3af6c9) they don't really care either. I for one refuse to use a 32 bit browser just for Flash. If I really want to see something with it I just use the MacBook. (Although I wonder what'd be the case with OS X 10.5 Leopard coming, as it is said to be a true 64 bit OS.) If you want to help the (truly) 64 bit community, [please sign this petition](http://www.petitiononline.com/lin64swf/petition-sign.html?).
