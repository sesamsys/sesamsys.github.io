<p>Recycled content. -- In another life, I went to the <a href="http://www.zoobudapest.com">Budapest Zoo</a>. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that it is, after all, a great place. In the end I almost ran out of CF card space.</p>
<p>I just remembered I had the pictures because Semcon was doing some decoration and we offered our pictures to be framed for the office walls. Mine didn't get used, but I was reminded to make <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sesamsys/sets/72157626752733608">a Flickr gallery of my favourites</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sesamsys/5734595055/in/set-72157626752733608">white wolves</a> are the coolest.</p>
