To contradict all the melancholic and sorrowful content of these past... weeks (?), here's a post that is bound to make anyone at least smile a little bit. **There will be cake as well.**

[Rocky and Balls](http://rockyandballs.com) are two girls from Leeds who sing sweet ditties about the most mundane things and still manage to be funny. They are also known to bake, watch this:

This May they released a 10-track full-length album titled [We Like Cake And Beards And Stuff](http://rockyandballs.bandcamp.com/album/we-like-cake-and-beards-and-stuff) which costs only â‚¤6 on [Bandcamp](http://rockyandballs.bandcamp.com) to own. Alternatively you can listen to the witty lyrics and ukulele here. (If you buy the whole album you get an ultra special otherwise impossible to acquire version of Ke$ha's "Tik Tok" called "Spit Spot".)

They are also found on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/rockyandballs) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/rockyandballs).
