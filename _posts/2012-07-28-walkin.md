[Juliana](http://julianaricherdaily.com)'s planning to go on a musical road trip, and as means of funding she [offers a demo single of her latest original song for whatever money people want to pay](http://julianaricherdaily.bandcamp.com/album/walkin-demo-single), may it be a cent or a thousand cents (or none).

Also, as a gift, all her covers from the past _three years_ are available for download, no charge at all. That's more than four hours of mostly girl-with-a-guitar music. Check it out [on her Bandcamp page](http://julianaricherdaily.bandcamp.com) and don't forget to read her message.

> Please feel free to download and share all of this with anyone and everyone, because sharing is caring and the world could certainly use a little more of that.
