Catastrophies cause more catastrophies and this chain continues until the end of the world comes. At least it seems like this now. Today morning I wanted to charge my mobile and... yes, you can guess it, my charger was gone, too. I assume the one who stole my mp3 player thought that the charger lying next to it belonged to it and took that as well. So now I have no player and I cannot use my mobile either. This thing really starts to grow on me... I mean I won't have enough money to replace all these in half a year... I hope if not a human but God will punish the damn thief who took my belongings... may he die a painful and torturing death, may the ravens be fed with his eyes, may he get SARS. Forget forgiverness I want revenge!
