The transition to the new host has finished. **SeSam.hu** is now powered by [wpress.hu](http://wpress.hu). It still might take a few hours for all the DNS servers to update and direct here, but essentially all's done. The [RSS feed](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/sesamhu) is still under FeedBurner so that should work without readers noticing anything.

The transfer was surprisingly hassle-free. I received a lot of help: I only needed to provide the data to be uploaded, and the rest was done for me. The new server seems a lot snappier as well, so I think I made the right choice.

You may have noticed that the /WordPress part disappeared from the address (if it didn't you are still on the old site). This is a change I've been wanting to make for a while now and this server move provided a good opportunity. The links in the posts have been fixed as well.

As usual, should you stumble upon any, please do report any possible malfunctions or broken links via email or comments.
