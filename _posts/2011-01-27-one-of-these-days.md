I'm going to cut you into little pieces. With an ice skate.

I was reading through the Wiki page for the Pink Floyd song when I stumbled upon this:

> Hungarian figure skater [Krisztina Czak√≥](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krisztina_Czak%C3%B3) used "[One of These Days](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_These_Days_\(Pink_Floyd_song\))" (along with "[Shine On You Crazy Diamond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond)") as the music for her long program at the [1992 Winter Olympics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Winter_Olympics), **one of the few times that a classic rock song has ever been featured in an elite-level ice skating competition**.

She was barely a few months older than 13 at the time. Now I don't know much about figure skating (other than it is nice to watch) but awesomeness of this magnitude I couldn't let go unposted.
