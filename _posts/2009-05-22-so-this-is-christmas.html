    Szigorú.
    Viszont érdekes, hogy pl Koda Kumi Tabooja már vagy 8 hónapja fent van és nem sok mindenkit zavar. Ha te megsértetted a szabályzatot a videóiddal, akkor ők is..

    Egyébként a vimeónak van a legnormálisabb minősége és a lejátszója is a legkevésbé tolakodó..

<p class="intro">Vimeo staff informed me that I am a <em>persona non grata</em> on their site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your account has been removed by the Vimeo Staff for violating the Rules of Vimeo.com</p>
<p>Reason: Uploading game walk-throughs, game strategy videos, depictions of player vs player battles, raids, or other videos that simply depict individuals playing a video game.</p>
<p>We hope you find a video host more suited to your needs. If you believe this was an error, please reply to this email in a civil manner with your reasoning ("I see other people do it" is not a valid reason).</p></blockquote>
<p>In a sense they are right. I had two videos uploaded. One of them was <a href="http://sesam.hu/2008/12/31/world-of-goo/">a screencast I recorded of the ingenious World of Goo</a>. If anything it was a promotion of the game to the readers with me awkwardly narrating in Hungarian. Can't be more than ten people who ever watched it.</p>
<p>The other video was a "trailer" for a never realised movie project made by one of my ex-guildmates in WoW. I only put it online so I could <a href="http://sesam.hu/2009/01/27/pvc-return/">embed it to sesam.hu</a>.</p>
<p>Vimeo is famous for hosting only quality content anyway and since I can't be charged with creating anything worthwhile it's surprising they haven't made the move earlier.</p>
