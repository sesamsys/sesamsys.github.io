She sent me a fax with a stamp on it.  
She thought a quarterback was a refund.  
She tripped over the cordless phone.  
She put lipstick on her forehead because she wanted to make up her mind.  
She told someone to meet her at the corner of "Walk" and "Don't Walk".  
She took a ruler to bed to see how long she slept.  
At the bottom of the application where it says "Sign here", she wrote Sagittarius.  
If she spoke her mind, she'd be speechless.  
When she heard that 90% of all crimes happen around the home, she moved.  
She got an AM radio. It took her 9 months to figure out that she could use it at night.  
She stood staring at the frozen orange juice because it said "Concentrate".
