I'm sorry that the site wasn't available for a few days. The reason is very prosaic. Despite the numerous emails I received reminding me of the domain needing renewal, in the end I forgot to actually wire the money to the registrar. Laziness or forgetfulness I don't know... but it does tend to reflect my life.
