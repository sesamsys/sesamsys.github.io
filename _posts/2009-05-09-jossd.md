The following dialogue took place in the season finale of Joss Whedon's latest show, [Dollhouse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135300):

> **Ballard:** So this is it, this is where you steal their souls.  
>  **Topher:** Yeah, and then we put 'em in a glass jar with our fireflies.

Now seriously, how cool is that, providing a witty remark and dissing Fox in one sentence.

(If you need an explanation: It's a reference to how Fox 'stole the souls' of the creators of the cult show [Firefly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461) by canceling it only after eleven aired episodes. Now Fox is about to do the same with Dollhouse.)

You can't deny that the man has style.
