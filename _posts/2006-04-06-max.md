Welcome to Darwin!  
rokko_b-040:~ 0511691j$

is what welcomes us (well, those of us that start up a terminal) in the computer rooms this year. The uni bought loads of iMacs - I don't even want to count them, they must have cost a smaller fortune. Well, it was high time they did: the loading time on most of the old Windows ones took the better part of a quarter of an hour, and I'm not exaggerating here. Fun to see all the *nix commands I know perfectly working on the Macs. (I'm awaiting the revolting comments of my fellow classmates, that they can't use Macs and anyway they are useless, _different_. Although in Japan they tend to like Macs, after all, they can afford them.) By the way, this is the reason of English: I am using a school computer, and the keyboard lacks Hungarian special characters. Yes indeed, the end-of-the-world cable-cutting hath cometh, for I have Internet no more.
