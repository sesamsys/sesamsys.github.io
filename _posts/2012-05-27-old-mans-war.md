I've always found the huge white space on Goodreads reserved for a review after reading a book quite daunting. Here's an attempt to fill one:

> I've found this book fascinating mainly because of two things. First, it deals with those eternal questions we humans probably had ever since climbing off of trees. It's as much a philosophy book as science fiction. Neil Gaiman wrote in an essay about ideas that a great way to come up with them is to ask questions: [Old Man's War](http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/Old-Mans-War-John-Scalzi/9780765348272) has sprung from really gripping ones.
> 
> Second, the way it's been put together. It has those sentences that, once you're familiar with the context, hit so right home it's stupefying. Maybe that's literature: words strung one after another in a way they imply a world beyond. It borders magic.
> 
> There're also spaceships and aliens, of course.
