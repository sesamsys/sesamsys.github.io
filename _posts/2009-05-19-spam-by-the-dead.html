    Hands down one of the coolest ways of in-game advertising.
    Nice find. :)

    @Tudor:
    Even if it's illegal in a way... :/
    But true.
    Nice work ^^;

    I guess it is the GM team's job to remove them #_#;
    But how? Do they ban them?

  content: I suppose they do ban them eventually. Nevertheless the dead orcs were
    there for quite a time and they do reappear every once in a while.

    This is very old. It's been done for years.
    And it isn't hard for those sh*theads to get from starting area to OG, the use hacks as teleport or speed.

  content: Probably it didn't take long for the spammers to get creative in circumventing
    Blizzard's attempts to curb their advertising opportunities. Nevertheless this
    just started on my server. Speed hacks can certainly come into play, I forgot
    about that.

  content: Not only speed hacks. They're using some kind of hack to die as well. They
    fly up in the air somehow and then fall to their deaths.

<p class="intro">For the second day now corpses of lvl 1 dead orcs litter the area between the Orgrimmar bank and auction house  on our server. At first I didn't pay much attention to them but today I noticed that when looked at from the top the bodies actually spell the following:</p>
<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090518-gc27p76g5t9t7ry1ke87i4kh4t.png" alt="pkpkg-goldseller-ad" /></p>
<p>Of course pkpkg.com is a(n illegal) gold seller site. Nevertheless I have to give it to them, this is the first time I saw this kind of advertising.</p>
<p>The trick behind it is simple: if your character dies and you log out in ghost form instead of resurrecting then the body of your character stays there visible for everyone else on the server. Still this is a lot of work, the bodies need to be positioned the right way and running from the starter area to Orgrimmar with over fifty characters must be a pain as well.</p>
<p>But at least there is something new and innovative after the flood of spam on the trade and city channels and the throng of level 1 characters whispering gold seller site addresses.</p>
