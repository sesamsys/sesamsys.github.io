<p>Looks like not just legally but also economically we are transitioning more and more back to Communism where the only thing in abundance is scarcity. At least that's what I thought yesterday when several items I intended to buy were simply unavailable. Or maybe I shouldn't have delayed Christmas shopping until the 20<sup>th</sup>?</p>
<p>At least I got around to updating the tagline and <a href="http://sesam.hu/about">About</a> page.</p>
