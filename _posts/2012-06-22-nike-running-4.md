A new version of the [Nike+ GPS app](http://gonike.me/NikeRunning) hit the store today. The interface is redone from scratch matching the design of the also [new HTML5-driven website](http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus). I love all the changes so far. My favourite is the new landscape history view, where the list of runs morphs into a chart. Seeing this made me want to go for a workout right then:

With this version the app is no longer iOS exclusive, they released [an Android application](http://gonike.me/NikeRunningRobot) as well. And for a limited time both are free to download, so go grab them while you can.

**Update:** To save yourself the annoyance, upgrade to 4.0.1 to fix the lock screen / background bug. Thx [@verkutya](http://twitter.com/verkutya).
