<p>A 5-piece band from Sheffield, UK, producing energetic British rock. They are reputedly fierce live, but to make sure of that you have to be in the country. Only one song is free to download; a few others are <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Violet+May/+tracks">available to listen full length on Last.fm</a>.</p>
