How about breaking the chain of dark music and melancholia with a bit of reggae. I stumbled upon [Gravefruit Sound](http://gravefruit.hu) on Facebook even though the local stations are said to have picked up their hit song _Szabad leszek_ (I'll be free). It's quite catchy.

The best part is that their 2009 album _Kéz a kézben_ (Hand in hand) is [downloadable for absolutely nada from their (very amateurish) site](http://gravefruit.hu/letoltes_kez_a_kezben.php). The package comes with reasonably good ID3 tags and an acceptable cover image for the 256kbps mp3s.
