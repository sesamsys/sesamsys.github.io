Just hours ago, somewhat out of the blue, [The Gathering](http://www.gathering.nl) released a song from their upcoming album _Disclosure_.

  
Clocking in at almost eight and a half minutes this one's as epic as expected with nice long instrumental sections. As a novelty the track starts with the keyboardist Frank Boeijen singing some vocals.

The song is not only for streaming, it is [free to download in a multitude of formats](http://thegathering.bandcamp.com/track/meltdown).
