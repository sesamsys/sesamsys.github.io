Today during the dorm newcomers' party I had a chat with a Japanese girl. She told me that in Kansai University of Foreign Studies, where she goes, they have some foreigners. The foreigners' room has an all-glass wall so that everyone passing by can take a good look. One day the inhabitants of the room decided to put out a sign saying " _don't feed the animals_ " until the university office made them remove it.

Also, there's no gravity.
