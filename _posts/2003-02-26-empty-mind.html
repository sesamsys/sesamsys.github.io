<p>The weather is tricky. The sun is shining but it is cold outside and the wind blows as well. It is Wednesday, that means I survived the first two most difficult and tiring days of the week, but I am drained in energy very much now.</p>
<p>To my great sorrow today won't be an inch shorter than the two days before. I have tons of things to do.</p>
<p>And I have an emptied mind. No words to tell, only thoughts awaiting to be formed into words. :(</p>
