<p>Absolutely no comment: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7102962.stm">Japan ups checks for foreigners</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Japan says the new move is an anti-terrorist measure that will also cut crime.</p>
<p>Human rights organisations say it violates foreigners' rights to privacy and could encourage xenophobia.</p>
<p>They complain it implies that foreigners are most likely to commit acts of terrorism or commit crimes on Japanese soil.</p>
<p><strong>So far there has been no terrorism in Japan committed by foreigners.</strong></p>
<p>Incidents like the sarin gas attacks on commuters on the Tokyo subway were carried out by other Japanese.</p></blockquote>
