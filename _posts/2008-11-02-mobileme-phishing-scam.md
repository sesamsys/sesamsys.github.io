Received the email below today - allegedly from Apple:

![mobile me phishing](http://img.skitch.com/20081102-db5k9fgy1fkgn44e8ntqi854yq.jpg)

Not a good fake. For one Apple would never leave a typo in the subject or use full caps for that matter. Checking the source there are a number of clues as well. The from email address is forgeable by a three year old so I leave it at that.

No emails from Apple are encoded in Windows-1251, nor do they use Outlook Express to send automated mails. [Fort Wayne Structural Products Corporation](http://www.fwspcorp.com) is either a fake as well, or one of their computer acts as a [zombie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_computer) for sending out phishing emails. Definitely not from Apple though.

[Educate yourselves about phishing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) not to fall victim to such scams. [MobileMe has a page to help as well](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2080).
