Last week the company we do contract work for took us to a team building to Lake Balaton. The main event was sailing in randomly divided small groups.

We were really unfortunate with the weather: on the day of sailing there was barely a breeze blowing and the sky was mostly covered by clouds. (Ironically, we traveled back to the capital the day after in bright sunshine and fierce winds.)

Some of my teammates were really anxious to actively participate and couldn't wait to tug at ropes and such, which wasn't really necessary due to the conditions. I on the other hand rather took the captain's advice, leaned back, listened to the waves crashing against the hull and just generally enjoyed the ride.

Then and there [I was present](http://sorhab.freeblog.hu/archives/2011/09/10/Ott_vagy_az_eletedben).
