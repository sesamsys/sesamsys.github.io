I think we all would be just fine with [reading these news](http://www.fugue.com/pics/goodnews.html), don't you agree? Do yourself a favour and take a little time off. Just browse through this spoofed Google News page, and pretend for a minute it's the real thing.

Especially the first entry of the entertainment section made me smile.

Is it possible to make it real? I think so...and certainly hope so. Maybe start with [one girl](http://hirbehozo.blog.hu/2008/06/07/the_girl_effect).
