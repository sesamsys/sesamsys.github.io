<p>She sent me a fax with a stamp on it.<br />
She thought a quarterback was a refund.<br />
She tripped over the cordless phone.<br />
She put lipstick on her forehead because she wanted to make up her mind.<br />
She told someone to meet her at the corner of "Walk" and "Don't Walk".<br />
She took a ruler to bed to see how long she slept.<br />
At the bottom of the application where it says "Sign here", she wrote Sagittarius.<br />
If she spoke her mind, she'd be speechless.<br />
When she heard that 90% of all crimes happen around the home, she moved.<br />
She got an AM radio. It took her 9 months to figure out that she could use it at night.<br />
She stood staring at the frozen orange juice because it said "Concentrate".</p>
