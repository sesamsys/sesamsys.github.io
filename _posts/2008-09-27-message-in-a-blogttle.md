Being home I concluded that blogging is a lonely occupation. There weren't many updates because I had people to meet, places to go and stuff to do. This was my last day at home, so from Sunday, when I arrive, things will be the same. At least some, while other things will be completely different. Nevertheless, stay tuned. :)
