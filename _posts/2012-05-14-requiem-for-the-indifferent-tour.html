<p>Tonight's real show was started by <a href="http://xandria.de">Xandria</a>. I think they were somewhat surprised of the warm reception, being a support act and all. I for one would have gone to see them solo.<br />

<p>Then, <a href="http://epica.nl">Epica</a>. I think they are still holding on to the throne of best symphonic metal act by far. Their musical mastery is only second to their humility. And Simone is breathtaking. Oh, we also got to jump around to the disco-ified <em>The Phantom Agony</em> again.<br />
