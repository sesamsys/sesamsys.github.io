New year, new plans. I aim to organise my trainings and races more systematically.

Just this weekend I'm going to compete at SÃ¶rmlands Winter Trail, a race I signed up for when I was in a better situation, nevertheless the challenge is still there. Then this follows:

* 8 February - [SÃ¶rmlands Winter Trail](https://www.sormlands-winter-trail.com/) (43k)
* 15 March - [Ursviks Ultra](https://www.ursvikultra.se/information) (75k)
* 29 March - [PermiÃ¤rmilen](https://www.stockholmmarathon.se/premiarmilen/) (10k)
* 26 April - [PremiÃ¤rhalvan](https://www.stockholmmarathon.se/premiarhalvan/) (21k)
* 31 May - [Stockholm Marathon](https://www.stockholmmarathon.se/) (42k)
* 7 June - [Ultra Trail Hungary](https://ultratrail.hu/en/) (111k)

And then if I'm still alive I might sign up for the [100 miler](https://www.sormlands100.com/100-miles) again. ðŸ˜¶
