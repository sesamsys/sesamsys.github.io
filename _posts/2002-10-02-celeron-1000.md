Busy days follow even more busy days. Yesterday there was an AIESEC meeting, and today there will be another one plus I am going to the cinema to see {3000 miles to Graceland}. I somewhat like Kevin Costner but I am absolutely curious about Courtney Cox... ;)

I might succeed in buying a Celeron 1GHz processor and my brother will get a computer as a present from our parents. You know what this means... LANparty@home! :) If everything goes well on Sunday we will be able to play together finally. I am thrilled.
