This is what I've been talking about. It is friday night now and no changes have been made to sesam.hu although I announced them. No worries though if my exams are successful I'll have all January to do what I want. ;) 

Santa Claus brought me a book I was longing for for a long time now. (If you are curious why Santa Claus comes on 6 December you are supposedly not Hunagrian. If requested I explain everything via email, just ask. :) ) Anyway I got The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. I will need to put up with much temptation not to read it instead of my macroeconomy book...
