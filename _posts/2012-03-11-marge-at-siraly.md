Who would have thought I'll see [these](http://sesam.hu/2011/04/10/marge) [two](http://sesam.hu/2011/05/09/simko-varnagy-mihaly) playing together.

The question remains however, that if these latest shows are meant to introduce the second album, then where is it? I couldn't even find out the title of the song I recorded.
