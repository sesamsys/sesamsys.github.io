On the basement level at Ginza Station there is a Sushi restaurant that holds three Michelin stars. I could have walked by it during my stay in Tokyo and not even notice it. [Sukiyabashi Jiro](http://www.sushi-jiro.jp/index.html) (すきやばし次郎) is lead by head chef Jiro Ono, aged 85. [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925) is the documentary that tells his story.

It's simply astonishing that after seventy-five years spent honing his skills in the same line of work he still talks about getting better. Despite the fame, he still follows the same routine, takes the train to work, his eldest son - now in his fifties - rides a rickety-looking bike to the [Tsukiji fish market](http://sesam.hu/2012/01/10/tsukiji). If there's anything to take away from this move, it's that talent by itself is meaningless without [dedication and diligence](http://sesam.hu/2011/07/21/we-are-what-we-repeatedly-do).

If you've ever had sushi, go see this movie. (And think again.)
