<p>Can't decide which is more amazing, that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868219">Guillermo del Toro</a> is <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2007/06/im-not-very-good-at-this-whole-title.html">shooting</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411477">Hellboy 2</a> in Hungary or that Neil Gaiman's there too (with Maddy, <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2007/06/meet-your-guest-blogger.html">apparently taking over his blog</a>). I don't know, maybe there'll be some book signing even? And I'm ten thousand kilometers away. So typical...</p>
