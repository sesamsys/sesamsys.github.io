There might be a little bit of silence again. I will be at an AIESEC event during the weekend and I suppose next week will be extremely busy and exhausting for me. I will try my best and post from the university computers though. :)

I didn't forget about the 'thing I wanted to tell' either. I will come up with it eventually. (Some more marketing. ;) )
