On Japanese Twitter I saw a lot of tweets ending with「なう」— a grammar structure I wasn't familiar with. Only it looked a lot like 'now' in Hiragana. But it couldn't be that easy, could it…

Turns out that yes, that's exactly what it is: a compact way to indicate something happening presently. It can be used with a noun or a verb, like 'coffee now'「コーヒーなう」or 'eating ramen' 「ラーメン食ってるなう」. It's not proper Japanese though, of course.

If you speak the language, here's a thorough explanation: [twitterの「なう」の意味と使い方](http://nanapi.jp/258).
