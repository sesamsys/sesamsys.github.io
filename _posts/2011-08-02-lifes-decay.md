This is quite a mixture of genres, mainly dark acoustic sounds with a touch of classical. What really makes it interesting is the French vocals. After all, [Life's Decay](http://www.last.fm/music/Life%27s+Decay) is a Paris-based duo offering several tracks as free downloads on Last.fm.

I got _Inksterna_ (2007) in the radio but also liked _Emerance_ (2009):
