    Yeah, I was exploring the wonders of Hungarian criminal law until 4 a.m.

    That's what I was doing.
    That's what I always do.
    That's what I'm gonna start doing now too.

    :(

[Opinio Juris](http://www.opiniojuris.org/posts/1193168003.shtml) has linked [this very short quiz](http://www.funtrivia.com/trivia-quiz/World/International-Law-225157.html) for everyone to test their knowledge in International Law. I got 6/10, but the questions seemed rather easy. So for someone really studying this, it should be an easy ten. (I missed questions 1, 3, 8 and 9.) It's remarkable though that only 27% answered question #7 about _ius ad bellum_ right.
