  content: I'm gonna keep this short and sweet as I don't want to lecture anyone or
    argue w how people feel (even though I disagree w most of your points). You're
    my favourite on twitter. Take care and don't turn what I've just said into something
    negative about you.

I've learned several things over the course of the week.

For example that I should probably print out cards containing a brief synopsis of what happened with me in Japan and why I'm home. It'd be a lot less embarrassing/painful to hand those out rather then retell and relive countless times.

That people still assume studying abroad is without a price to pay. Something like being a student in Hungary, except a lot better.

That I can't tell what I'm planning to do now because - frankly - I have no idea either.

That I still have the emotional maturity and social skills of a Hollywood teen comedy protagonist - you know the one that makes all the stupid mistakes and behaves like a moron. Only in real life there's no happy ending at some airport.

And finally that people really don't change: once a flop, always a flop.
