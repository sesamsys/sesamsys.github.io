Tonight I went out (heard that Salvaes? :). I do enjoyed talking to old friends (gosh, I sound like seventy years old...). What I enjoyed less is the way home which is a regular pain for me. At night there are no buses, so all I can do is walk. I am ok with walking but I don't very much like walking alone (in the dark) to home at night. As our family has no car that is not an option either. By the way this results one thing I like about Budapest, there are buses ALL the time.

On second thought there is another choice: somehow change the fact that I need to go home alone (no, forget Maculay Culkin). However at the current status of the world or at the current setting of the stars or really dunno, this in not an option either again. To my great sorrow.
