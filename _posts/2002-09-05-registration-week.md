I am at home again after the 'zeroth' week of the university. My first impressions are quite good, it seems I will have a good time in Budapest. :)

These 5 days are called 'zeroth' week as no teaching took place, no lectures or seminars were held. All we had to do is register ourselves for the first year, look around, visit the library and familiarise ourselves with the life at the uni. Of course the instructors of the groups were of great help in this.

And now comes apologising: The cause of not adding any content to this site is that I left the password for the ftp server on my home computer, so I couldn't access the site at all. Sorry about this.
