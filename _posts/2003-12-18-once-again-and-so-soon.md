Don't ask. I've been extremely busy. (I am extremely busy right now as well, it's just a sudden constellation of stars that allowed me to post. :P) 

Exams are coming along with Christmas. Sadly I am doomed to spend most of the time learning. On the other hand I am supposed to have an all-free January if I pass everything for the first try - which is what I plan of course.
