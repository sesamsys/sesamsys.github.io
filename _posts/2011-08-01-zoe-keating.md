She is a classically trained cellist producing her own albums while composing music for TV, film and ballet. Her instumental ambient-chillout melodies set a mellow atmosphere. [Zoë Keating](http://www.last.fm/music/Zo%C3%AB+Keating) has one free track available on Last.fm, _Exurgency_ , however the leading track from _One Cello x 16: Natoma_ is also [available to listen to in full](http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Zo%C3%AB+Keating/_/Legions%28War%29).

[Neil Gaiman](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/12/short-tired-trout-filled-post.html) seems to appreciate her as well.

Also, if you like cello, don't forget to check out [2CELLOS](http://sesam.hu/2011/06/16/2cellos) and [Misi Várnagy](http://sesam.hu/2011/05/09/simko-varnagy-mihaly).
