Looks like not just legally but also economically we are transitioning more and more back to Communism where the only thing in abundance is scarcity. At least that's what I thought yesterday when several items I intended to buy were simply unavailable. Or maybe I shouldn't have delayed Christmas shopping until the 20th?

At least I got around to updating the tagline and [About](http://sesam.hu/about) page.
