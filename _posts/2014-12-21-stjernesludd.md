I've found the perfect Christmas song.

Here's [the original performed by DumDum Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_6tgUTjkuM) in Bergen. [Lyrics translation and explanation over here.](http://www.watchingpaintdryminutebyminute.com/2011/12/stjernesludd-lyrics-breaking-down-text.html)

> Kjartan Kristiansen used to be a drug addict, and the title Stjernesludd (star sleet) probably refers to bad heroin (the kind of heroin that is killing people more frequently).
