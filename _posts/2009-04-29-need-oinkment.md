The [Unliving Swine](http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=25600) of Borean Tundra seem to have [a very interesting ability](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50303):

[![Swine Flu - Spell - World of Warcraft](http://img.skitch.com/20090429-xdp4tk6369ub7imbjn3fyskp9g.png)](http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50303)

Of course, hilarious as it is, this is by no means an attempt by Blizzard to poke fun at a potentially deadly disease. This spell has been in game since the first beta version of WotLK came out about a year ago. Besides, there has been [Swine Flu cases in humans as early as 1976](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_flu#1976_U.S._outbreak).
