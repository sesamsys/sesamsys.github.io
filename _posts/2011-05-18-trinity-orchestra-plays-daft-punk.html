<p>I really only seem to have time for music posts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trinityorchestra.com/">Trinity Orchestra</a> is the only fully student run orchestra in Ireland. In this video they are playing Daft Punk's album <em>Discovery</em> in Trinity College Dublin's Exam Hall. First of all, let the sheer awesomeness sweep over you: the many instruments, the arrangement and the enthusiastic musicians. Secondly, how great is that study hall of theirs?</p>
