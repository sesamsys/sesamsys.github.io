I don't think I'm really qualified to introduce this properly so here are the simple hard facts: one of my favourite books, **Neverwhere** by Neil Gaiman, **is available** [to read online or download for offline reading from HarperCollins for a month](http://www.harpercollinsebooks.com/NeilGaiman?WT.mc_id=REFL_NVRWHR_NGCOM_082908). **Totally free of charge.**

Also [highly recommended by Isolde](http://isolde.hu/archives/2008/09/03/I_have_never_been_to_St_Johns_Wood_I_dare_not), who you should trust more than me.
