I got an email from Nike rewarding me with an iTunes song code since I participated in the 10k Human Race they organised earlier this year. So now I can "buy" any song priced at no more than Â¥200. (That's most songs.) The only thing is, I'm not sure what I'd buy. I might end up supporting one of my favourite artists by choosing their songs but feel free to recommend anything. My listening habits can easily be familiarised with from [my last.fm page](http://www.last.fm/user/sesamsys).
