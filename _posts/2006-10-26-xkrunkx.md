[This](http://www.blizzard.com/wow/images/screens/insider/020/comics/ss69.jpg) is a fanart comic strip for WoW. The reason why I'm posting it - apart from being very funny by itself - that this is exactly how my name works in a Japanese context... (And wee, I refrained from ranting about the appalling names people give their WoW characters.)
