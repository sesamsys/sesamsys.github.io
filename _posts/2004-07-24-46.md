**I am aware that the gallery is not working. The thing is that yesterday it was full of pictures and for today it has become empty! All the pictures disappeared and I cannot log in with my username either. I have no clue how or why did this happen. I am trying to figure it out though it is not much that can be done. The pictures seem to be lost. ;'(**
