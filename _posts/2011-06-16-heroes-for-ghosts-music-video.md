Following a total eclipse of the moon, the music video for [the pre-released The Gathering song](http://sesam.hu/2011/05/17/heroes-for-ghosts) has just been released. Written, directed, filmed and edited by [Marcus Moonen](http://www.youtube.com/user/marcusmoonen), their friend, the clip has been shot in Norway ([Silje's](http://sesam.hu/2010/02/01/team-silje) homeland) in its entirety.

After numerous listens I can assert that Heroes for Ghosts is still masterfully composed: especially the instrumental parts range from ethereal beauty to angry oscillation. The video just strengthens these impressions. Do yourselves a favour and watch it in HD.
