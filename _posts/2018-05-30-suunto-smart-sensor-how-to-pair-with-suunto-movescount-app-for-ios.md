**Are you, like me, curious how much battery power is left in your Suunto HR belt, a.k.a. Smart Sensor?** Fortunately the Movescount mobile app does supply this information. However, the instructions on how to pair the Suunto Smart Sensor with the app are quite outdated.

I have written to Suunto support about this but all I got as an answer were the [canned instructions about tapping the watch icon in the app](https://suunto.helpshift.com/a/movescount/?s=general&f=how-do-i-pair-my-suunto-smart-sensor-with-suunto-movescount-app), etc. Even though I have expressly stated that this is where they have changed the app's behaviour and it no longer looks for HR belts, only watches.

Anyway, through the UK phone support a representative helped me out by revealing that this functionality has moved to where you register Moves with the app. You can connect your HR belt by tapping the `+` sign next to the watch icon, selecting `Register a Move with the app` and tapping the heart rate icon in the lower left corner. If you're wearing the belt and it gets paired the app will also show the battery level.

I think it's high time Suunto updated their online manuals and instructions, though.
