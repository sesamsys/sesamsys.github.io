So, does your company have its own superhero?

Check out ours: he's called [Sky High](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_%26_Bunny#Heroes) (スカイハイ) and he's the _King of Heroes_ in the Japanese anime television series [Tiger and Bunny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_%26_Bunny) (タイガー＆バニー).

He is very cheerful, optimistic and polite. His abilities include being able to control the wind and air currents and he can fly with the assistance of his jetpack. The front of his uniform is branded with the [Ustream](http://ustream.tv) logo.
