A man of words and not of deeds  
Is like a garden full of weeds  
And when the weeds begin to grow  
It's like a garden full of snow  
And when the snow begins to fall  
It's like a bird upon the wall  
And when the bird away does fly  
It's like an eagle in the sky  
And when the sky begins to roar  
It's like a lion at the door  
And when the door begins to crack  
It's like a stick across your back  
And when your back begins to smart  
It's like a penknife in your heart  
And when your heart begins to bleed  
You're dead, and dead, and dead indeed.
