It's like a garage sale for city dwellers. On a set date you can throw out all your unwanted junk in the street to be collected. Of course, before that, hordes of people who make a living out of this scan through the heaps, collect anything that's remotely usable and argue over the more precious loot. More often that not you'd find a corpulent gypsy male sitting in an armchair battered beyond recognition (most likely extracted from the junk) next to every deposit doing guard duty.
