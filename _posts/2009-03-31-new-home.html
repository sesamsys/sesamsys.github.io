<p>The transition to the new host has finished. <strong>SeSam.hu</strong> is now powered by <a href="http://wpress.hu">wpress.hu</a>. It still might take a few hours for all the DNS servers to update and direct here, but essentially all's done. The <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/sesamhu">RSS feed</a> is still under FeedBurner so that should work without readers noticing anything.</p>
<p>The transfer was surprisingly hassle-free. I received a lot of help: I only needed to provide the data to be uploaded, and the rest was done for me. The new server seems a lot snappier as well, so I think I made the right choice.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that the /WordPress part disappeared from the address (if it didn't you are still on the old site). This is a change I've been wanting to make for a while now and this server move provided a good opportunity. The links in the posts have been fixed as well.</p>
<p>As usual, should you stumble upon any, please do report any possible malfunctions or broken links via email or comments.</p>
