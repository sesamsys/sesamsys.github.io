[Tantrum to Blind](http://www.tantrumtoblind.com) is a Swedish pop-punk band whom I heard about on [WoW](http://eu.battle.net/wow/en). It turned out that the brother of one of my guild mates is the bassist. They have a weird video featuring a stuffed bear and Stockholm scenes. Unfortunately no free songs.
