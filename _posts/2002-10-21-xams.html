<p>Waking up on Monday mornings is a pain. I really have to reorganise my timetable next semester so that I won't need to attend 8 o'clock lectures. I am really looking forward to this because - sadly - freshmen always get a ready-made timetable and there is no chance to change it really. Needless to mention that this means 8 o'clock lectures on every single day...</p>
<p>In general I am happy or at least balanced and satisfied. I have all my work done at AIESEC so I can concentrate on learning for my exams next week. And as October 23 - a national holiday in Hungary - is on Wednesday I can go home on Tuesday as I have no classes on Thursday. (W00t I really have to make a sentence that contains all the days of the week... it's so confusing ;)</p>
<p>I am going to the cinema on Tuesday (days again... ;) to watch Bloody Sunday. I am pretty much excited about the movie. I hope it will bring back the feeling of the long gone English lessons in Grammar School. (I wouldn't ever have thought of that I would be this much sentimental about English classes half a year later. Well, seems I am...) What I expect is that the movie is historically correct and has some love in it. Love is a must. If I lack it in my everyday life at least I want to watch it in movies.</p>
<p>I was told I use too much emoticons and triple dots... ;) Not... at... all.. :)</p>
