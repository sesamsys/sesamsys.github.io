So I was going to check out a video on YouTube which turned out to be geobanned: _Unfortunately this content is not available in your region because the owner has not granted the respective music publishing rights_. Bla bla.

All right, I thought, this has happened before. Let's try the phone which is on a non-proxied network. Only I was reluctant to go through the hassle of navigating to the video by hand and tried to look for an easier solution, such as sending a link directly to the Android browser.

It didn't take long to find the [Chrome to Phone](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oadboiipflhobonjjffjbfekfjcgkhco) extension-app pair which was just what I was looking for. Or so I thought. Because when I tried to install the app on the [Nexus S](http://sesam.hu/2011/07/04/nexus-s) I was greeted by the following error message: **This item cannot be installed in your device's country.**

Really, Google? Where's the much praised Android freedom now?
