Probably all my Hungarian readers have seen it as it's been posted to [Cink](http://cink.hu/ugye-milyen-klassz-a-budapesti-kozlekedes-vagyis-a-rol-715978058) but this is what I've spent my last 14 minutes watching. A simply amazing video of commuting in Budapest from mass transit to the airport. It's the creator's (Ádám Pátzay) graduation work, completed spanning eight months. Highly recommended in full screen and HD.
