<p>Do you beleive in horoscopes? I sometimes read my horoscope in the papers just out of curiosity. If it predicts a good day/week for me it fills me with satisfaction while if it says my future is dark I can simply say: horoscopes are not true. Today's horoscope promised me success and joy all over the day, and for today's keyword it selected dignity.</p>
<p>As for the painful truth nothing happened the way I wanted today, I wasn't succesful in anything I had today and I was more a fool than a dignified person. In the morning I woke up early to catch the train to Budapest for I had a Sociology exam as you might already know. On my way to the train station I was running to a bus when due to the ice-covered pavement I fell on my back... right into a puddle. My suit got wet and dirty all over. (remember the keyword: dignity!?)</p>
<p>*Luckily* my trousers somewhat got dry during the train trip. (The train had a 20 minutes delay.) When I arrived to the university I went to check out where my exam wiould be. To my great surprise I didn't have an exam at 9AM but 2PM as the paper said. (The exam started at 9AM but there were groups arranged and I was in the 2AM group.)</p>
<p>Well, what could I do in a dirty suit with a whole morning available. I played cool guy and went to the cinema. :) I watched Sweet Home Alabama. I had great fun and I think this was the top of my day which I didn't know that time...</p>
<p>The exam gone very bad. I didn't seem to know what I knew even. I was scaringly dumb.</p>
<p>So what is the moral of this story? Well I should have learned more. I shouldn't have ran to catch the bus when I *knew* the pavement was slippery. I should have asked one of my friends to ceck out the exam paper for me so that I could have known exacly when would have I my exam. All in all, I sucked today bigtime. :(</p>
