I snatched [the video using photos to show a trip to Japan](http://sesam.hu/2009/01/14/this-is-japan) from [yummie.hu](http://yummie.hu) last time as well. Inspired by the idea [human](http://twitter.com/humaninsect) now made one himself about a weekend in Budapest. This is how our capital looks in winter.
