There is little hope I can get my lost pictures back. Right now it seems like the gallery has been deleted and installed again leaving a blank database. I have no idea how could that happen as it is only me who has access to the administration interface and I certainly didn't do such thing. Now I am waiting for an answer from the support if they have any backup. If not, then - with regret - I'll consider the pictures be lost and start from the scratch again, uploading new pictures.

Recent events proved that it might be for the better if I wrote journal entries in English, having now many readers (for the time being picture-viewers only) from foreign countries. I originally wrote my journal in English previously as well. The only reason I changed is because some of my relatives don't speak the language. I put up a poll to ask you which language you prefer. For the time being I plan to use English.
