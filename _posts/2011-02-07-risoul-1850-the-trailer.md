Probably most of the people who have seen an iMovie '11 trailer find the whole idea boring and obnoxious. However, my brother and I had a lot of fun making this and I assume, at least for the eight of us who have lived through it, it means something. There might be an actual longer movie to come as well. As you can see, we had a very good time.
