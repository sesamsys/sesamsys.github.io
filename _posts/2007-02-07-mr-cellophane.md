If someone stood up in a crowd  
And raised his voice up way out loud  
And waved his arm  
And shook his leg  
You'd notice him

If someone in a movie show  
Yelled "fire in the second row,  
This whole place is a powder keg!"  
You'd notice him

And even without clucking like a hen  
Everyone gets noticed, now and then,  
Unless, of course, that person should be  
Invisible, inconsequential me!

Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name!  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there!

I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me walk right by me  
And never know I'm there...

Suppose you was a little cat  
Residin' in a person's flat  
Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?  
You'd notice him

Suppose you was a woman wed  
And sleepin' in a double bed beside one man for seven years  
You'd notice him

A human being's made of more than air  
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there

Unless that human bein' next to you  
Is unimpressive, undistinguished  
You know who...

Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there  
I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there  
Never even know I'm there
