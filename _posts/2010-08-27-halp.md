There is something bugging me and my brother and I was wondering if there's anyone out there able to explain.

This is also a bit of a spoiler if you haven't read Audrey Niffenegger's _A Time Traveler's Wife_ , so consider yourself warned.

There's the bit where Henry explains his crimes during his _episodes_ :

> "So in order to cope, I pick locks, shoplift, pick pockets, mug people, panhandle, break and enter, steal cars, lie, fold, spindle, and mutilate. You name it, I've done it."

Everything else we know except what **fold** and **spindle** mean as crimes. They either have some obscure slang meaning obviously missing from dictionaries or are maybe synonyms for stretching the truth?

Any ideas?

(If you have the Hungarian translation, what does it say? Book I, Chapter _Eat or Be Eaten_ )
