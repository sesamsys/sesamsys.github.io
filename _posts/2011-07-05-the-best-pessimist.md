This is the one man project of musician and composer [Sergey Lunev](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Best+Pessimist) from Odessa, Ukraine. He has several piano-driven instrumental post rock pieces to[ download for free on Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Best+Pessimist/+tracks). So far my favourite is _I Just Want To Be Your Everything_. I can relate.
