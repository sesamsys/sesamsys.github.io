<p>Only wanted to install an app to the iPhone using another iTunes than it syncs to... turns out that warning that says all applications will be replaced is actually true: it promptly deleted all the applications previously installed on my phone. (The test devices we have do not behave like this for some reason.)</p>
<p>What can you do if this happens? iCloud backups can be used to painlessly restore a phone to its original state, here's how (please note that WiFi access is needed):</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset and choose Erase All Content and Settings</strong>. This is equivalent to a factory reset.</li>
<li>Go through the steps of the Setup Assistant and enter your Apple ID.</li>
<li>Choose a backup to restore to.</li>
<li>Profit.</li>
</ol>
<p>First the settings are restored, then the phone reboots and begins to download all the applications, their data, the photo stream, <em>everything</em>, Really it's equally <a href="http://sesam.hu/2011/01/18/phew/">as magical as Time Machine</a>: when it finishes the phone is exactly in the same state as it was during the backup. Mine even got the alarm for that morning switched on.</p>
