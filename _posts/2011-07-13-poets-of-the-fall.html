<p>This one came from my newest last.fm-ified friend, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/MidniteMage">Midnite</a>. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Poets+of+the+Fall">Poets of the Fall</a> play really pleasant alternative rock and are from Finland. Their single <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Poets+of+the+Fall/_/Late+Goodbye">Late Goodbye</a> appeared in Max Payne 2 as the title song. Check out <em>Maybe Tomorrow is a Better Day</em> from <em>Carnival of Rust</em>.</p>

<p>I was told to see them live one has to travel North, because they won't do gigs elsewhere other than Scandinavia and Russia. Prepare your <a href="http://sesam.hu/2010/12/18/usanka-meno/">ushankas</a>.</p>
