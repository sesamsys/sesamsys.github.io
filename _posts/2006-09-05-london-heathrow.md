Back to _my civilisation_ where wireless Internet costs 5 GBP per hour. T Mobile FTL. Still Heathrow is a good old friend, especially since I almost died of boredom here on the way home last Christmas. Security is quite tight, literally: they frisk everyone at the checkpoint. Also passengers are asked to remove shoes and belts. Luckily no urine sample or blood test... yet.

Sidenote: OK, it's expensive but this wifi is faster than most of wired the accesses we have in Hungary.

(I know this post shouldn't be on the fifth, but it's already 2.00am in Japan and the blog is set to JST.)
