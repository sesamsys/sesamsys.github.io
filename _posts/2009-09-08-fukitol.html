    oh, following a little mishap in a morning after a pretty wild karaoke night the tyre of my bike was dead. i had to buy a new one, and with my 3 weeks of japanese studies, that was fun (naturally i did not look up the words in the dictionary, why would've i). after explaining that i was looking for the thing inside the round thing (literally), it turned out it was called "tube". nice.
    i know about that feeling when they look at you as if you were a rotting roach, the problem is i get that feeling with some of the teachers in school...

<p>Getting rid of my stuff is not really working out as I have planned.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to have my bicycle fixed. I had to get a valve adapter first because - obviously - my bike had a different valve than the Japanese standard. It was fairly easy after I figured out that my valve is called "French". (Ever tried asking for something at a store that you didn't actually know the name of?)</p>
<p>The bike was outside the whole winter and it looked like that. I am a pretty bad bicycle owner it seems. At least I managed to snatch one of the two stalls that have a makeshift roof - still almost all the screws were covered in rust. I spent an hour or so in the blazing sun cleaning the parts as well as I could then pushed the bike to the store to put some air in the tyres.</p>
<p>I haven't ridden fifty meters from the store when at a stop sign the chain broke. At least I was close to help: I crawled back and asked for the chain to be fixed. Funnily enough the store owner was either born with a frown or he hates foreigners but he regarded me all along as one might look at a particularly disgusting roach. It was quite a change after all the bowing and pleasantries of the usual Japanese way of treating customers.</p>
<p>I ended up paying ¥1.500. (He could have said five hundred or forty-five hundred for all I know - very convenient if you want to skin a rich American foreigner.) He also told me off for having too much grease on the chain. Like I said I'm not very well versed in bicycle maintenance.</p>
<p>Anyway, today I set off to look at stores that might buy some of my household appliances and books. I learned fast that no bookstore ever buys textbooks for some unfathomable reason so that option's out. And then on the way to the recycle shop my chain broke <em>again</em>. The closest bicycle shop I knew about was close to my ex-dorm but I only arrived there to find a notice that it has permanently closed business.</p>
<p>This is where I said <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBb5v1sJhuU">Fukitol</a>.</p>
<p>I locked the bike up at the dorm. (Conveniently it boasts the sticker that is needed to park there and the room number is nicely blurred.) I took the rest of the afternoon to take pictures for <a href="http://sesam.tumblr.com/">the daily photo blog</a> and buy food at Sannomiya.</p>
<p>If life gives you lemons find a small child with open wounds.</p>
