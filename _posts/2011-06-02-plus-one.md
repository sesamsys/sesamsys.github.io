Google [unrolled](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/1-button-for-websites-recommend-content.html) the [+1 button](http://www.google.com/+1/button) for websites to embed. It's pretty easy to implement using [the webmaster page](http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/index.html).

Think of it as **a like button for websites** : if you find something cool you can recommend it to your friends who may receive these via their search results, personalizing their searches. [More information in the explanation video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAyUNI3_V2c)

Even though it's located on the right sidebar it works on a per address basis: subpages - such as standalone posts - can be plus-oned independently. Additionally, it seems to have none of the horrid performance issues of the Facebook like button.

+1 if you like :]
