**James Bond:** I already have a dinner jacket.  
**Vesper Lynd:** There are dinner jackets and then there are dinner jackets; this is the latter. And I need you to look like a man who belongs at that table.  
**James Bond:** How...? It's tailored.  
**Vesper Lynd:** I sized you up the moment we met.
