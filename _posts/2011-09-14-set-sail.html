<p>Last week the company we do contract work for took us to a team building to Lake Balaton. The main event was sailing in randomly divided small groups.</p>
<p>We were really unfortunate with the weather: on the day of sailing there was barely a breeze blowing and the sky was mostly covered by clouds. (Ironically, we traveled back to the capital the day after in bright sunshine and fierce winds.)</p>
<p>Some of my teammates were really anxious to actively participate and couldn't wait to tug at ropes and such, which wasn't really necessary due to the conditions. I on the other hand rather took the captain's advice, leaned back, listened to the waves crashing against the hull and just generally enjoyed the ride.</p>
<p>Then and there <a href="http://sorhab.freeblog.hu/archives/2011/09/10/Ott_vagy_az_eletedben/">I was present</a>.</p>
