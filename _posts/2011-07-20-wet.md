I'd be surprised if I won't catch a cold after today; basically all my clothing below the waistline (not covered by the raincoat) is soaking wet. Jeans are not particularly fast to dry out either.

Still, this is nothing compared to my all time greatest rain-soak, which happened on[ the day I tried and finally succeeded in finding my stolen bike](http://sesam.hu/2005/07/04/japanismeret-101) in Kobe. That time even my backpack was permeated.

I guess the second best would be the time when I was getting home from class, still in Japan, and it was raining so heavily that the downhill roads turned into little streams of steadily flowing water. At one point I realized that the white stuff on my bare-feet sandals was my own skin, drenched and peeling.
