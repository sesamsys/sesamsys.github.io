Almost all my belongings have already been moved to my new dormitory. They still need to be sorted out though, which is not a very pleasant work at all. But then again the work you never start takes the longest time. :)

Finally we started some programming stuff at IT lessons. Only Visual Basic which seems to be a toy compared to Delphi, but it is still more fun than Excel. I will need to get it to my home computer as well and write some example programs just to see how it works...
