Yeah, I know, I should post 'n' stuff. But I've started watching Lost again and it's, like, exhilarating! As a result now my free time is dedicated solely to Lost. Sorry.

By the way, if you haven't already, get [Firefox 2](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox). It knows how to spell exhilarating. Just what I needed.
