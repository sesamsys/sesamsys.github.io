  content: Hm. "Ima" is not that new actually. I think it just has taken some time
    to get into the non-American folks heads.

    it's okay, but in writing it hurts...

I used to blog about the they're/their/there problem, and now I got to the point where sentences like "get there towers u nub" in AV don't even make me wince. Alas, grammar is dead.

However, something that is quite new - at least to me - piqued my interest. Anyone who saw at least one Hollywood movie knows about "[gonna](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/learnit/learnitv165.shtml)" as a shorter form of going to. Recently I noticed people saying "ima go n get there towers" and such. Now this might be because of the server being Oceanic, nevertheless I'm guessing it's a global trend. To use "ima" instead of "I'm gonna" (I'm going to) that is.

The real horror is when they start putting the "a" after other personal pronouns like: "hesa go n kill u nub" :evil:

Anyway, some googling turned up [this gem](http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html;jsessionid=263B6EC6EB1E0711F013EB96A6FD014E?topicId=4191343875&postId=42238565913&sid=1) I can't really trump:
