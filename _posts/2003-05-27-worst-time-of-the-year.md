Exams. *chokes* Many exams for me this week. I am trying my best to learn however this kind of learning (huge books to read and learn by heart) I disdain. No innovativeness included. My little trick is that I came to Budapest to my dormitory where there is no TV or computer in my room -> the only thing to do really is learning. I hope it will work.
