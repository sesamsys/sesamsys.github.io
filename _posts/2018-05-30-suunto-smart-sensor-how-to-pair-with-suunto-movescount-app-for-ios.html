<p><strong>Are you, like me, curious how much battery power is left in your Suunto HR belt, a.k.a. Smart Sensor?</strong> Fortunately the Movescount mobile app does supply this information. However, the instructions on how to pair the Suunto Smart Sensor with the app are quite outdated.</p>
<p>I have written to Suunto support about this but all I got as an answer were the <a href="https://suunto.helpshift.com/a/movescount/?s=general&amp;f=how-do-i-pair-my-suunto-smart-sensor-with-suunto-movescount-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canned instructions about tapping the watch icon in the app</a>, etc. Even though I have expressly stated that this is where they have changed the app's behaviour and it no longer looks for HR belts, only watches.</p>
<p>Anyway, through the UK phone support a representative helped me out by revealing that this functionality has moved to where you register Moves with the app. You can connect your HR belt by tapping the <code>+</code> sign next to the watch icon, selectingÂ <code>Register a Move with the app</code> and tapping the heart rate icon in the lower left corner. If you're wearing the belt and it gets paired the app will also show the battery level.</p>
<p>I think it's high time Suunto updated their online manuals and instructions, though.</p>
