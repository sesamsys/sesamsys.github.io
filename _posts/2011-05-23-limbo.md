[![Busch Gardens - "Montu" Roller Coaster](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4936190044_c54f9e97be_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24736216@N07/4936190044 "Busch Gardens - "Montu" Roller Coaster by roger4336, on Flickr")

It's been very much like a roller-coaster these days. Had I ever tried drugs I'd imagine the highs to be comparable. And the lows, well, I'm no stranger to deep dark ones anyway.

It's all good, though, since were I not experiencing this oscillation of moods I'd complain about the lack of it for sure. It's better to live than vegetate. And this time I won't give up my dreams so easily.
