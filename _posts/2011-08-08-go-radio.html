<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Go+Radio">Go Radio</a> is a pop-punk band from Tallahassee, Florida. They have one free download track on Last.fm, <a href="http://freedownloads.last.fm/download/469855358/Any%2BOther%2BHeart.mp3">Any Other Heart</a>.

<blockquote><p>Although former Mayday Parade vocalist Jason Lancaster was looking for some much needed time off and to get away from the daily grind of being in a band, he wasn't idle very long. Jason was soon putting together and fronting Go Radio. Just after the release of the debut album Lucky Street, Jason along with Alex Reed, Matt "Burns" Poulos and Steven Kopacz stopped by for a Last.fm Discover session. Start by lsitening to the heart-wrenching story that Jason has never really told in detail behind the song "Any Other Heart".....then witness the rest of the session at <a href="http://lastfmdiscover.radio.com">Lastfmdiscover.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p>They are also found on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/goradio">MySpace</a>.</p>
