Unlike my previous music posts, chances are, you probably haven't heard about this band. [Vanity & Jokes](http://www.last.fm/music/Vanity%2B%2526%2BJokes) is the solo project of [Udo Pesch](http://www.last.fm/user/up71) and at the time of writing this he had a grand total of 652 plays on Last.fm. Regardless, I think he has an interesting voice.
