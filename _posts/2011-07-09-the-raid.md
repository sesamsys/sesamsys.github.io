> "You know that day-dream you had as a little kid? The one where you and your friends got together to battle the evil dragon? Well, these guys are kind of _doing_ that. Every night."

[The Raid](http://jointheraid.com/site) looks like a really interesting project I just found out about: filmmaker Kevin Michael Johnson teamed up with some people from [TankSpot](http://www.tankspot.com) to produce a full-length documentary on raiding in [World of Warcraft](http://eu.battle.net/wow/en).

The film is aimed at the general public to let them share - and maybe understand more - the excitement and feeling of this kind of experience. Hopefully it would even help with improving the general image of people who play MMORPGs.

The filming was done in 2010 so the newest expansion, Cataclysm, is not included. The footage has scenes from Icecrown Citadel from back when The Lich King was boss.

For starters I recommend reading through the project's initial [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theraid/the-raid-promo) page. There is also a trailer for the documentary that will premier streamed on 6 August.
