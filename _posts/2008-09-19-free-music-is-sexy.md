    Shearer are also offering their two albums for free:

    The page is in German though and the music is rather punkish, but worth checking out if you like stuff like that.

Ain't it? Well the Netherland-based [Silence is Sexy](http://www.silenceissexy.nl) certainly thinks so. BH stumbled upon this release [on The Gathering forums](http://www.cyclingcolours.nl/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=7157), since their keyboardist, Frank Boeijen, plays on three of the tracks. To quote the band:

> Music is just like love, you have to share it. That's why we give away our new album This Ain't Hollywood for free.

I think it's pretty good indie rock. Recommended for fans of Snow Patrol, Coldplay, The Bravery and alike.

You can download the full album in mp3 format plus a booklet and the cover image [in a zip archive](http://www.everythingyoushouldknow.info/Silence%20is%20Sexy%20-%20This%20Aint%20hollywood.zip). Alternatively you can find the album [on Mininova](http://www.mininova.org/tor/1809685) if you're into torrents. [Last.fm offers all the tracks for listening through their radio](http://www.last.fm/music/Silence+Is+Sexy/This+Ain%27t+Hollywood?autostart), too. 

And if you like what you hear, [the first album of the band is available under similar conditions](http://www.mininova.org/tor/1786190).
