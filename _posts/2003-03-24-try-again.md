In an hour I will be writing my second-chance analysis exam. Why am I here writing an entry then? Well, because we students weren't informed about the exact timing of the exam again. I was pretty sure it would start at 2PM but the information system said between 12AM and 4PM... so you can never know. Needless to say this resulted in having free 2 hours of waiting before the exam starts. I don't think this has a very good effect on my future successfulness but then again what can I do about it? Sidenote: Did any of you notice that I am rather sarcastic before exams? Weird.

I wish it were evening already so that I could shift my mortal soul to a certain adventurer on Rubi-Ka.
