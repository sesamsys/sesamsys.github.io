Terrible things have taken place while I was away at the spring camp. In my dormitory room there are four beds, but I live alone, I have no roommates. This is why I keep everything - even valuable things - on the open. Today morning when I was about to set off to the university I was looking for my newly-bought mp3 player. To my great surprise it was gone. I looked in every corner and drawer but I couldn't find it, although I was quite postitve I left it on my desk. I informed the person who is responsible for the dormitory and he said there was a guy who slept in my room during the weekend. Despite of having been promised that no one-day rommates would sleep in the room, it happened. And likely he walked away with my mp3 player in his pocket. Now the dormitory directors are trying to track him down and question him, but still he can say anything... Needless to say I am very disappointed about all this. I just bought it, I used it at most four times and I was immensely happy I finally got my hands on a portable music playing gadget and now it is all gone. And the chance of getting it back is thin, alike the chance to get a new one. Thieving is one of the worst things to live down...
