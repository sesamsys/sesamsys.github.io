    "If you ask me itâ€™s worse than WMDs."
    I agree :D :D

Almost midnight here and I woke up to [the sound of music](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742). Our second neighbour is throwing a party apparently. And the music... well it's a clear sign of redneck equivalence: _nuptial techno_. The term may sound clumsy for which please accept my deepest apologies. The genre is called _lakodalmas techno_ in Hungarian, and it basically consists of well-known folk song lyrics sang to very simple but catchy electronic music. Originally such music was played during the parties after wedding ceremonies, hence the name. The cost of making such a record is minimal, albeit with guaranteed success. A majority of the tracks contain rap intermezzos for contemporaneity...

If you ask me it's worse than [WMDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction).
