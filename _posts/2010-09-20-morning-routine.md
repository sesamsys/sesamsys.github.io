    Huh, nice...
    Happened to me recently, my mother's coffee-maker went wrong. The safety valve broke, but onto a spare part, some is made to need to hunt, turned up under a week. If any would have been "Szarvasi" ones with Hungarian production I would have received a component in a shop promptly. (Magyarország így szeretlek...)
    / off tűzoltók jöttek, vagy csak simán bakelit illatú lett a konyha ?

I don't know what creative genius designed our coffee machine really. The way it works is the following: when the coffee is done the status light at the front darkens, _without the machine actually switching off_. So it falls upon the user to remember to flip the switch or pull the plug from the socket. Exactly my strong suite...

The parents' machine at least has the decency to keep its light glowing angry red reminding the usually semi-comatose operator that his job is not yet done.
