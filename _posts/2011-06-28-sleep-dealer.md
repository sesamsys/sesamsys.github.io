Stargazing melancholic post-rock music from Moscow. The one-man project's [first EP was released on the Radio Hand Netlabel](http://radiohandnetlabel.blogspot.com/2009/11/rh004-sleep-dealer-way-home.html) and downloadable for free, along with [several other songs from Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Sleep+Dealer/+tracks). Take your pick, or listen to _Nozomi_ (望み/Wish) here:

A slight problem is that the EP's Rapidshare link is down and the Russian site wants people to look at ads first and whatnot. Using mad skills, black magic and a lot of Google translate I was able to grab the file, sparing you, dear readers, from the hassle: you can [get The Way Home directly from sesam.hu](http://sesam.hu/download/Sleep_Dealer-The_Way_Home-2009.rar). Happy listening!
