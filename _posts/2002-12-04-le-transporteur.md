Today I could enjoy the great feeling of satisfaction more than once. I was able to finish all the tasks I scheduled for myself for today. Although I missed a statistics lecture... ;)

In the afternoon I was in the cinema to check out {The Transporter}. Well not the most dialugue-packed piece I have seen in my life, but this is its advantage. After the first couple of scenes the film offers action on action to the end. I had much fun watching it, and I think due to this the movie achieved its goal: entertaining.

I especially liked the part when the camera faced the front of that famous BMW. Like it has eyes looking at you, showing calmness, decisiveness. Very cool.
