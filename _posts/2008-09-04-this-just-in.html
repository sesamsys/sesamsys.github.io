<p>I don't think I'm really qualified to introduce this properly so here are the simple hard facts: one of my favourite books, <strong>Neverwhere</strong> by Neil Gaiman, <strong>is available</strong> <a href="http://www.harpercollinsebooks.com/NeilGaiman?WT.mc_id=REFL_NVRWHR_NGCOM_082908">to read online or download for offline reading from HarperCollins for a month</a>. <strong>Totally free of charge.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/09/mr-g-sends-us-present-while-hes-away.html">Neil wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For those people who grumbled about reading American Gods online, here's Neverwhere. You can read it online, and it's also downloadable. That's the good news.</p>
<p>The bad news is you don't get to keep it forever. It's yours for thirty days from download, and then the pdf file returns to its electrons. But if you've ever wondered about Neverwhere or wanted to read it for free, now is your chance. And free is free...</p></blockquote>
<p>Also <a href="http://isolde.hu/archives/2008/09/03/I_have_never_been_to_St_Johns_Wood_I_dare_not/">highly recommended by Isolde</a>, who you should trust more than me.</p>
