<p>Note: you can read this post <a href="http://futo.blog.hu/2012/10/09/sesam_budapest_maraton">in Hungarian on Futóblog</a>.</p>
<p>For the second time, the Marathon is harder. During <a href="http://sesam.hu/2011/10/03/budapest-maraton/">the first</a> you feel like writing history: you've never run this much before. You're proving yourself. Levelling up is at stake.</p>
<p>When you run it the second time, you know what to do: been there, done that, nothing to see. Moreover, there's the time to preferably beat, in my case 3:58'09".</p>
<p>Just like last year, I haven't prepared properly <a href="http://sesam.hu/2012/10/06/3339/">this year</a> either. I'm the kind of runner who trains randomly. When I feel like it I run around the city somewhere and the distance also depends on my mood at the time. The only exception is when I participate in some online challenge, that's how I ran almost 200 km in July. Anyway, it's all quite unprofessional.</p>
<p>Regardless, I joined the 3:30' pace-setters at the start, come what may. The weather was exceptionally good, cool and cloudy. My co-workers who ran relay complained of the heat afterwards, but that didn't bother me much. Last year it was worse, the participants were <a href="http://sesam.hu/2011/10/08/kuhlwasserschlauch/">sprinkled by hoses</a>. This time not even the inflatable gate that showers water was switched on. At the start we were warned of the wind on the riverbanks, also something I wasn't bothered by.</p>
<p>I managed to keep up with the white balloons until the first relay point, where I spent about half a minute looking for my partner in the wrong place. (I was also the first member of a three-man relay.) Moral: make sure to read up on the correct place to switch beforehand and pay attention to the signs.</p>
<p>From that point we soldiered on together with Bence keeping even distance from the pace-setters. We passed the half-point at 1:49', which is only a five minute improvement to last year, but at the time it felt so much better.</p>
<p>Last year I started wearing out at the 27th kilometre and it wasn't any different this time either. The garden variety muscle ache in my legs I could live with but my left ankle started stabbing at certain angles as well. This injury I sustained at Volt Festival jumping in front of a stage. I tried rolling on my distal sole minimise the pain.</p>
<p>I first walked at a bridge ramp and soon after I fell behind of my relay partner. I was called out by an English guy not to walk so for a while we had a chat. He very much liked the city and the competition, particularly how well organised it was.</p>
<p>At the 33rd kilometre I met more and more relay runners resting by the track and I envied them a lot. This was the only time when I imagined how awesome it would feel to lie down in the grass for a while and give the whole thing up, after all this is just madness. Rather, I continued and amused myself with making calculations of still improving my time by running 6 minute kilometres.</p>
<p>Meanwhile some chemical my body has released stopped the pain in the ankle or maybe I just learned how to step right. In exchange I started staggering funnily when my calves cramped after landing. When that happened I needed to walk a little to recover.</p>
<p>At the 37th sign we finally left the riverbank, no way not to finish after that. Unfortunately all the runners who'd conserved their strength better started taking over. I was calculating possible finish times at every GPS notification. The frequency of the cramps increased.</p>
<p>I've lost all the accumulated time advantage in the last two kilometres: simply after all the flying phases my legs cramped badly I tried stopping to stretch with little to no success. I managed to run a couple hundred metres by pulling my toes upwards as much as I could in the shoes. I was going to finish crawling if I had to.</p>
<p>Nearing the finish line I managed to imitate continuous running to have this picture taken.</p>
<p><a href="http://sesam.hu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sesam_befuto_jav2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3516" title="befutó" src="http://sesam.hu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sesam_befuto_jav2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="368" /></a></p>
<p>However, on the last two hundred or so metres I had to resort to walking again despite the cheering coming from the sides. It wasn't like I didn't want to run after all.</p>
<p>I helplessly watched the clock tick over my time from last year and hobbled through the finish line at 3:59'47". There was some malfunctioning of the timing system so the gross time ended up to be the official. Anyhow, I managed to smile a bit for the cameras.</p>
<p>Most likely this won't end up being my favourite competition, but heck, I've finished two sub-4h marathons now. Next time I'll be even faster.</p>
