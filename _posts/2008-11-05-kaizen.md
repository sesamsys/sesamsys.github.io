I received a very ugly photocopied paper in my mailbox informing me that the **Rules of Garbage Collection** have changed and **Failure to Comply** will result in **Severe Punishment**. From now on garbage can only be placed at the appropriate **Clean Stations** in the **Kobe City Municipal Designated Household Garbage Collection Bag** (神戸市家庭系ごみ指定袋). The bags can be purchased at local supermarkets in three types. Red for burnable garbage (including plastic), green for non-burnable garbage (glass, chemicals), and finally blue for cans and PET bottles.

Now don't be mistaken: there are still separate locations for the different garbage types. One can't just place any bag at the closest drop-off point. The collection is still done on three distinct days at separate designated points once or twice a week between 5 am and 8 am. There is just the added requirement to use the new plastic bags.

My biggest problem with this all is that the bags are just huge: 45 liters. I probably produce 45 liters worth of litter in two weeks or so. So now the options are either to let the garbage rot until I fill the bag or just use a fraction of its capacity. The bags are of course pricey.

Exactly what this country needs is **More Rules**.
