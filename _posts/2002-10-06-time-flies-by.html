<p>This weekend meant more fatigue than recreation for me. I stayed at my accomodation at Budapest for Saturday to help my brother buy his new computer (a damn good one compared to mine). Then at home we set up a network and played some multiplayer games together which we have been planning a for a long time now. However now my train back starts in no time and I have to pack and travel again which I pretty much hate. One can hardly gasp for air on the trains at this time that much crowded they are. This makes the route back very exhausting and unpleasant. And next week won't be easy either I fear... May I be blessed with strength!</p>
