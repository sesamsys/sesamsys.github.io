  content: "Everything has to start from somewhere, and I also feared that who would
    freely give up personal data. \r\n\r\nHowever in one month, we did collect 3500
    km and decided to map these tracks, not waiting for the 10 000 km . This map will
    be included in the next updates which does give functionality to the app:\r\n\r\nWhere
    cycle all the other cyclist? \r\n\r\nThis is quite useful if you are in an area
    you don't really know the routes near by. \r\nSince this is a hobby project at
    the moment we are very pleased with the results and hope that cyclist will also
    appreciate it. \r\n\r\nShould you have any ideas which would be useful for you,
    just let us know."

    does indeed look interesting! The project turned out quite nice. Maybe we even
    get more tracks?

Just the day after I wrote about BAM I bumped into this [piece of news about a project called Budapest Cycle Track](http://webisztan.blog.hu/2011/04/29/budapest_cycle_track_mennyit_tekernek_a_budapesti_bringasok). The creators attempt to **collect traffic data** via iPhone and Android apps to **map popular bicycle routes** through the capital in order to **find out where new tracks are most needed**.

The app itself doesn't have much functionality other than mapping, calculating the distance and sending over the data. This is where I see the issue, [similarly to BAM](http://sesam.hu/2011/04/29/bam). **Why would anyone bother loading up an app just to supply data.** Many would, I guess, but if penetration is the goal, something like this won't be enough.

At the time of writing this [only 114 km was submitted to the website](http://budapestcycletrack.appspot.com). The visualisation would be created once they reach 10.000. I have my doubts.

Not to mention, given the current leadership, building new bicycle tracks look like to be the lowest priority.
