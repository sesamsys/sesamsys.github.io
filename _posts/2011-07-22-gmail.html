<p>Partly due to the <a href="http://sesam.hu/2011/07/04/nexus-s/">horrid implementation of the stock IMAP mail app on Android</a> and partly due to the elegant new look of the web interface you may recall that I made the switch to Gmail a while ago.</p>
<p>After a few days of use I devised the following inbox-zero method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mail I read and been done with gets archived.</li>
<li>Mail that requires some kind of action later gets starred then archived.</li>
<li>After processed, starred items are un-starred.</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems to work well enough so far.</p>
<p>However, the one thing I have issues with is search. I'm spoiled by the MobileMe / Mail.app power-search which indexes everything instantly rendering the use of folders and the like obsolete. Say I am looking for the confirmation email from my hosting provider,<a href="http://sesam.hu/2011/02/16/neveto-tintahal/"> Laughing Squid</a>: a quick search pops all messages with these keywords no matter where they are or how long ago I received them. Why would I want to organize mail into folders then? Or, for that matter, stick labels on them.</p>
<p>Enter Gmail: for some reason the search does not find all the emails I want it to find. Maybe it doesn't search in messages received years ago or doesn't index them all, I don't know. Alternatively, something got messed up during the import and some of the emails weren't copied over...</p>
<p>On the desktop I bought <a href="http://sparrowapp.com/">Sparrow</a> because it was made specifically for Gmail. I am yet to test it but I'm afraid it will suffer from the same search problem. One solution would be the shiny new Lion <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/apps/#mail">Mail.app</a> (which indexes everything) but would that be able to use the archive method Gmail prefers with the labels?</p>
<p>On that note I still haven't found a use for labels.</p>
