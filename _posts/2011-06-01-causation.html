<p>I suppose after a certain age - or kindergarten - everyone is familiar with the joke in which the patient repeatedly touches various body parts and complains of pain which, in turn, gets identified as a broken finger. Â Following this analogy if a series of endeavors all turn out to be failures of differing degree then how's that to be interpreted as anything other than an issue with the attempter.</p>
