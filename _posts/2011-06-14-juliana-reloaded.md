[I wrote about Juliana Daily's music back in February](http://sesam.hu/2011/02/11/juliana-richer-daily) noting that her original songs are unfortunately not accessible internationally. I'm happy to announce this is no longer the case: for barely a price of a beer ($3) you can get either the [Falls From Trees EP](http://julianaricherdaily.bandcamp.com/album/falls-from-trees-ep) or the [Birdsongs EP](http://julianaricherdaily.bandcamp.com/album/birdsongs-ep), each with three numbers. As per [Bandcamp](http://julianaricherdaily.bandcamp.com) standards a plethora of lossy and lossless formats are available.

For encouragement, here's her latest cover of _Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground_ by _The White Stripes_.
