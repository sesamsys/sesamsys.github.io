<p>SeSam.hu is now upgraded to <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> version 2.7. Apparently <a href="http://sesam.hu/template/">the Make It Worn template</a> works flawlessly with it.</p>
<p>Visitors won't notice much - maybe slight speed improvements - but for me it's a huge change. The revamped admin interface is a pure win. Almost everything is a box: reorganisable, customisable and removable. The whole blogging experience is starting to feel like using a desktop software. It puts in such sharp contrast the times when I used to edit HTML by hand in Notepad for each and every post. And it wasn't even that long ago.</p>
<p>Kudos to the WP team who continue giving this awesome CMS away, absolutely free of charge.</p>
