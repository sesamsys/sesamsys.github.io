I'm sure this has been circulating on the _internets_ for quite a while, but since I haven't been religiously following Barack Obama's every step from the senate to presidency, it took me by surprise when I saw [a link to Obama City in Fukui Prefecture](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=Obama,+Fukui+Prefecture,+Japan&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=20.842015,56.601563&ie=UTF8&cd=2&geocode=FameHQIdVFQXCA&split=0&ll=36.456636,135.74707&spn=16.617129,28.300781&z=5&iwloc=addr) in my Google Reader shares.

This is a beautiful example of multiple readings of the same kanji. 小 (little, small) is usually "ko" but in names it can be pronounced as "o". And 浜 (port, beach) is though usually "hama" when in a compound it sometimes goes through a phenomenon called [sequential voicing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendaku) (連濁) adding a _ten-ten_ to the first kana: "bama". Thus the compound reads: **Obama**.

Obviously the [City of Obama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama,_Fukui) tried to exploit the popularity fanned by the presidential candidate as much as possible. Apparently the craze went so far that on inauguration day [a pack of hula dancers celebrated the first African-American president at one of Obama's (the city's) old temples](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28753038/displaymode/1107/s/2/framenumber/21). As for why _hula_... better not ask.
