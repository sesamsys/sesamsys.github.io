The [14th section](http://kektura.hu/utvonal/14-okt-reszturak/27-14-sz-tura-budai-hegyes-huvosvolgy-rozalia-teglagyar) of the [National Blue Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Blue_Trail) takes you through the hills of Buda. Starting from the [Children's Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyermekvas√∫t) it goes around a former airfield and over H√°rmashat√°r-hill ending at a brick factory operated by Wienerberger.

[![H√°rmashat√°rhegyi Rep√ºl≈ët√©r](https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7691/27312590645_2ea0688ded_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sesamsys/27312590645/in/album-72157666232091574/ "H√°rmashat√°rhegyi Rep√ºl≈ët√©r")

The airfield closed down in 2014 and is now pretty much just a grassy plain. When we were there some people flew model airplanes which sounded like mosquitoes. Since it used to be an official airfield, it even has an IATA/ICAO code: [LHHH](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/H√°rmashat√°rhegyi_rep√ºl≈ët√©r).

A gentle climb follows up to the [√Årp√°d-kil√°t√≥](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/√Årp√°d-kil√°t√≥) offering a scenic view of the city below.

[![H√°rmashat√°r-hegy](https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7640/27037433160_3843ae465c_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sesamsys/27037433160/in/album-72157666232091574/ "H√°rmashat√°r-hegy")

The next stamping place is up on H√°rmashat√°r-hill. The stamp used to be at the old lookout tower, but since its reconstruction the box was moved to a utility pole along the route. I assume now that the new tower's been finished, the stamp will be moved back to its old place again.

[![HHH-pecs√©t](https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7336/27279932816_fdbfa01fac_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sesamsys/27279932816/in/album-72157666232091574/ "HHH-pecs√©t")

By the time we were descending the hill the sun was close to setting.

A short walk later comes another stamping place where the weekend cottages start appearing. Here, again, [the official site](http://kektura.hu/utvonal/29-okt-reszturak/14/123-harmashatar-hegy-vihar-hegy-viragos-nyereg) proved to be outdated: the stamp is on a pole instead of being affixed to the first hut's fence. First time I saw a sign like this, though.

[![pecs√©t helye](https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7311/27215534812_91e87cd471_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sesamsys/27215534812/in/album-72157666232091574/ "pecs√©t helye")

From there the path mostly goes down in a serpentine track. Until the very end it stays in the woods. As the route curves around the steep hillside sometimes trees can be seen that could no longer hang on and fell. Even important ones, like this.

Current status: 35.6km of 1118km.
