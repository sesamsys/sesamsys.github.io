<p>My perception of girls lately is more along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote><p>You wouldn't want to make a universe angry. I bet an angry universe would look at you with eyes like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>You know, so it's not all flowers and humble expressions of admiration and gratitude.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool%20Stuff/Short%20Stories/How%20To%20Talk%20To%20Girls%20At%20Parties/How%20To%20Talk%20To%20Girls%20At%20Parties%20(Text)">the whole thing</a> here.</p>
<p>And we love you, of course, regardless.</p>
