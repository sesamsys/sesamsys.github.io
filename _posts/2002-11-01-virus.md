Hm. No update since the law exam (it was VERY easy...) again, but now I have pretty strong excuses:

Firstly I am sick, I have fever and all this stuff... it is likely a virus and I do hope I will be healthy again after a few days. Luckily it caught me yesterday, not a day before, because I had a mathematical analysis exam that day. About analysis: it was far easier than I was told and expected. Maybe I misunderstood things but I could solve the problems pretty fast... Lets hope I did everything right and the exam was easy for real.

Secondly... well you must have noticed it. Yep. The new site design. I thought I need a cooler site than SeSam.hu was, one that reflects my current skills in image-editing. :) If you like it - or not - feel free to drop me a {mail}.
