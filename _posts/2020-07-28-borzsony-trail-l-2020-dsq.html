<p>Kids, don't do this at home.</p>

<p>I didn't run so much as a meter in July and June wasn't much better either. With the pandemic, being unemployed, searching for a job, and doing an inordinate number of interviews I simply had no urge to train at all. So it seemed an excellent idea to sign up for a 35km, 1500m D+ trail run in Börzsöny, the most badass mountain in Hungary. My game plan: wing it, and see what happens.</p>

<p>I knew I could do it, but had no illusions. This is known as the hardest track of the Nyúlcipőbolt trail series and let's face it: in the past weeks I tended to get out of wind taking the stairs to my fourth floor apartment… so who was I kidding?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Still, finally, the atmosphere of a race! Arriving to the race center, greeting old acquaintances, getting ready, checking the compulsory gear, tightening the straps, the countdown to the start. Ah, how I've missed all this!</p>

<p>I managed to keep a good enough pace until the first checkpoint, but things started to go <em>downhill</em> from there at an alarming rate. I got dizzy at the refreshment desk just by leaning forward a bit. Then during the subsequent climb I had to sit down on a rock only not to faint. Boy, was I out of carbohydrates!</p>

<p>It was during this incline that I was overtook by the runner I thought to be the last. I was spent. I knew the track, I wasn't even halfway, and I was running out of water. Things didn't look good, and I had half a mind to call it quits. But this was Börzsöny, the mountain where you cannot quit, because, well, it's mostly wilderness, and there are no shortcuts.</p>

<p>With no other option but to soldier on I got a little bit of respite on the "runnable" part (red triangle sign) towards the next stop, the big cold mountain (the Hungarian name literally translates to that).</p>

<p>This second checkpoint was about to close up business when I arrived. I was in survival mode by then. I even forgot my flasks: one of the crew members brought them to me after I left. (Huge thanks!)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Only having a mathematical chance of matching the cutoff time, I took it easy. I didn't know when the checkpoints closed, and I arrived a couple of minutes late to Csóványos, the last hilltop. The crew had already left. I caught up with them just a little later while they were collecting the signal ribbons of the track.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at that point finishing was as easy as following a hiking sign to the race center. I caught up with another crew member dismantling the track and ended up arriving fifteen minutes later than the cutoff time. I wasn't even dead last, turned out a girl finished after me so I snatched the penultimate place. We both got medals (against the rules), but yeah, this was an official DSQ.</p>

<p>Börzsöny — as always — was stunning, but unforgiving.</p>
