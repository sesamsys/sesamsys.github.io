[The Echelon Effect](http://www.theecheloneffect.com) is David Walters from London, UK. He makes instrumental epic-sounding post-rock tracks often tending towards chillout and ambient. Some of them are free to download from [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Echelon+Effect), others are uploaded to [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheEchelonEffect). All songs, however, are available in lossless and lossy formats on [Bandcamp on a name your price basis](http://theecheloneffect.bandcamp.com) with no minimum set. Here are a few to try:
