[Proposition 8](http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm) was a California ballot proposition that changed the state Constitution to restrict the definition of marriage to a union between a man and a woman and eliminated the right of same-sex couples to marry. ([src](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_\(2008\))) A lot of prominent people opposed the proposition in many ways, however I found this one unique: Funny Or Die's [Prop 8 - The Musical](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/c0cf508ff8/prop-8-the-musical-starring-jack-black-john-c-reilly-and-many-more-from-fod-team-jack-black-craig-robinson-john-c-reilly-and-rashida-jones), starring - among others - Jack Black, John C. Reilly, Neil Patrick Harris.
