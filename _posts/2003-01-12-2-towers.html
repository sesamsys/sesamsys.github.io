<p>I haven't mentioned this here earlier but I have seen The Two Towers on January 9. This is one of the few movies that make me tingle in anticipation. And finally after a long year I could immerse in the miraculous world of Middle Earth again. I don't think I can go in any details of the film. Firstly because it is too dense in feelings that I have only scenes flashing in my mind. Like the departure of elves from Rivendell in the dead of the night, or the horses galloping on the endless plains of Rohan. Every second of the movie is a wonder. And secondly because I don't want to ruin your best three hours in this year. :)</p>
<p>It is a pity that my humble knowledge of this language prevents me from putting the experience this film offers in words.</p>
