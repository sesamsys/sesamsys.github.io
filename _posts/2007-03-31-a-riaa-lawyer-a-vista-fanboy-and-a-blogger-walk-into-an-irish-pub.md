This morning I was browsing. (Anyone remebers when it used to be called 'surfing'? Back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth and ISDN was every kid's wet dream.) Anyway, browsing, just checking the blogs I usually read and then moving on to their linkeds until I have more tabs than Safari can handle in one row.

One thread started on Yummie, then to '[Ihaveanopinion](http://velemenyemvan.freeblog.hu)' with a very [nifty article](http://velemenyemvan.freeblog.hu/archives/2006/08/10/Hogy_nyer_pert_a_RIAA_bizonyitekok_nelkul) about the RIAA's legal shenanigans posted in Hungarian. I recommend you to read [the original](http://digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com/2006/08/07/the-riaa-vs-john-doe-a-laypersons-guide-to-filesharing-lawsui) though. Diagnose and cure at one place, try [G2P](http://velemenyemvan.freeblog.hu/archives/2007/03/30/Not_P2P_G2P) if you are uncomfortable about torrent.

Quite unrelated but in the meantime I learned there's a [new release of the Creative Commons license versioned 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7249) with more internationalisation and Debian/MIT compatibility. For Hungary apparently still the 2.5 one is applicable.

I finally got around to change the nonstandard Youtube embeds on SeSam.hu according to [this post](http://yummie.hu/archives/2007/02/23/hogyan-lesz-valid-a-youtube-es-dailymotion-kod-ami-wordpressben-is-jol-mukodik) to valid XHTML, too. (Definitely annoying to have your clean code tainted by stupid Youtube.)

The other browsing thread started with a blog I used to read but since it moved there's no RSS feed for it. Laziness or not I like having blogs' RSS in the bookmark bar of Safari under a folder and check them only when they are updated. (It's also a great way to forget the actual addresses. Should something happen to my bookmarks, boy there'll be some creative googling...)

In the end I stopped at [Mac Thought Crime](http://macthoughtcrime.blogspot.com). Lately I'm just plain amused at the Vista Fanboys' Association - a prime example is in [all your gerbils are belong to us](http://macthoughtcrime.blogspot.com/2007/03/george-ou-all-your-gerbils-are-belong.html) \- I want to pat them on the head and tell them to go back to play with their $240 ... well I wanted to write tinkertoy, but the thing is [tinkertoy](http://www.hasbro.com/playskool/tinkertoy) is actually **creative**.

And finally you're in for a good laugh at the [O’ HANLON’S ORIGINAL IRISH SAKE](http://lungbrothers.blogspot.com/2007/03/idea-to-make-millions-n-462b.html) (A Mystic Taste of the Country where Tradition was Born). No, seriously, Japanese would be plain carzy to drink something like that.
