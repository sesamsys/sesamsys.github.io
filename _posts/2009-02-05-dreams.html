    "Now, can it get any weirder?"

    Wrong question: It always can be worse :)

    But I don't agree with you about we are not supposed to remember our dreams. I agree, that you remember your dream, when you are close to be aweake (REM phase), but it can mean, that you have slept enough. I've heard, that those, who don't sleep enough, rarely remember any dreams, but those, who sleep enough, remember more often. Of course, it is also bad, if you don't sleep deeply, and you are in REM phase-like state all night.

    Maybe, you should try counting sheeps :D (http://countyoursheep.keenspot.com/d/20030611.html).

    Have a good night and a fairy sleep ;)

    Actually... I dreamt that I was a guy (someone escaping from prison), and I slept with a woman, ... and while doing that I changed my race.
    How does that sound...

    Ever tried to understand the symbols behind the dreams?

<p>The things I have been dreaming about lately are quite unsettling. I blame the exams, and everything else that has been happening. Of course I haven't been this stressed out before, when tests and exams meant a lot less, when I started off from a strong base and I had confidence. Nowadays the stakes are a lot higher and everything matters considerably more and I find myself doing worse and worse.</p>
<p>I don't sleep too well either. I wake up at completely off times, then I get sleepy in the middle of the day. Also the little I know about dreams is that you're not supposed to remember them: only if you wake up in the middle of your sleep can you remember what they were about.</p>
<p>A few nights ago I was parking expensive cars and we were contemplating with my family - who weren't my real family but more like the Cullens from Twilight - how to fit the cars best in the very small place available. At least this one had a Japanese connotation: parking here usually means squeezing cars into the smallest gaps imaginable.</p>
<p>But then just recently I walked into a white building in my dream where the noted blogger <a href="http://plastik.hu">Angelday</a> sat at a table with the prominent Hungarian TV show host Friderikusz. I started talking to them when I realised they were doing a webcast reporting a tennis match. Then the dream shifted and they were in my home in my father's study. I thought then that it can't be any worse than dreaming about people from the freaking internet...</p>
<p>Finally today I was a seal. And I <em>gave birth</em> to a baby seal. Then we were discussing with my seal friends that this is a very bad season to have your first baby seal, because the weather's been so cold and we were lucky if we survived. I woke up realising I kicked my blanket off and my shoulder hurt. (I had my left arm squeezed under me one night and it's been hurting ever since.)</p>
<p>Now, can it get any weirder?</p>
