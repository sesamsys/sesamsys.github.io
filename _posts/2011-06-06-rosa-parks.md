[Rosa Parks](http://www.myspace.com/rosaprks) is a Hungarian [post-rock](http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock) band from Győr. I wouldn't go into rating the music here, biased as I am. Anyway, [both their albums are downloadable](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosa+Parks/+tracks) \- song by song - from Last.fm for free. I attached _0110_ from [Black Is The Color Of Bondage, Blue Is The Past](http://www.last.fm/music/Rosa+Parks/Black+Is+The+Color+Of+Bondage%2C+Blue+Is+The+Past) as a sample. They have a [tour blog](http://rosaparks.blog.hu) as well, with live videos. Next they will perform at[ Tündérgyár, 27 June](http://www.last.fm/event/1823788+Khuda+%3A+Iecava+Tour+2011%27+%7C+Part+I).
