I was about to hit the bed but before doing that I decided to have a glass of water. I went downstairs to the kitchen then switched off the lights and started ascending the stairs. When I was halfway upwards some eerie light flashed at my feet. I was scared to death before realising that my neighbour switched his car's lamps on and it lit through the smoke-glassed wall of the stairs. Phew.
