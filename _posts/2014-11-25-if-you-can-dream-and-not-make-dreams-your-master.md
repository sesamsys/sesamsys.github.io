Az idei F1 bajnoki címért a végén a [Mercedes AMG Petronas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_VGkwCoKfqh1eZEkzey3A) csapat két pilótája harcolt egészen az utolsó versenyig. A csapat pedig megtalálta [ezt az 1985-ös Rudyard Kipling verset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If—), ami tökéletesen illik a szituációra. Meg sok más helyzetre is.

_If you can keep your head when all about you_  
_Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,_  
_If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,_  
_But make allowance for their doubting too;_  
_If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,_  
_Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,_  
_Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,_  
_And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:_

_If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;_  
_If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;_  
_If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster_  
_And treat those two impostors just the same;_  
_If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken_  
_Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,_  
_Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,_  
_And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:_

_If you can make one heap of all your winnings_  
_And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,_  
_And lose, and start again at your beginnings_  
_And never breathe a word about your loss;_  
_If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew_  
_To serve your turn long after they are gone,_  
_And so hold on when there is nothing in you_  
_Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on!”_

_If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,_  
_Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,_  
_If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,_  
_If all men count with you, but none too much;_  
_If you can fill the unforgiving minute_  
_With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,_  
_Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,_  
_And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son._

**If—** by Rudyard Kipling
