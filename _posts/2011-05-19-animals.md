Recycled content. -- In another life, I went to the [Budapest Zoo](http://www.zoobudapest.com). I was pleasantly surprised to realize that it is, after all, a great place. In the end I almost ran out of CF card space.

I just remembered I had the pictures because Semcon was doing some decoration and we offered our pictures to be framed for the office walls. Mine didn't get used, but I was reminded to make [a Flickr gallery of my favourites](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sesamsys/sets/72157626752733608).

Also, the [white wolves](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sesamsys/5734595055/in/set-72157626752733608) are the coolest.
