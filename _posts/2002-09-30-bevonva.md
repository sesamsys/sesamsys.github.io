The AIESEC-weekend was great indeed. :) Now I am quite positive about taking part in some of the AIESEC projects running at AIESEC BUESPA (I've just learned this, this is the official abbreviation of Budapest University of Economy and Public Administration). There will be meetings at which the projects are discussed and the tasks handed out. All this seems very professional just like in a company. ;)

Ack! More: Damn! I have to do german homework... I hate it because the things we learn are far beyond my knowledge, so I cannot understand half ot the things half of which I want. So I will be at the language-labor for a looong time... :(
