I got internet access for my work SIM so now it can be used in the iPhone. As a result I could resurrect my old Ericsson R310s I managed to unearth from a box in the attic.

I loved this phone, it was the very first I had. This was the time when everyone was running around with Nokia 3210s and I wanted to be different. It has a wicked looking shark fin antenna and it's practically indestructible. Still in mint condition with a durable enough battery; I'm only missing the belt strap.

Random fact: Lara was using this phone in the first Tomb Raider movie in the Cambodia scene.
