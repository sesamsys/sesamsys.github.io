Today [Sparrow](http://sparrowmailapp.com) announced that it was acquired by Google. An excerpt from the notification email they sent:

> We will continue to make available our existing products, and we will provide support and critical updates to our users. **However, as weâ€™ll be busy with new projects at Google, we do not plan to release new features for the Sparrow apps.**

I came to like Sparrow, as an email client designed specifically for Gmail. Since Ustream uses Google Apps, I happily utilized Sparrow for my work mail while I kept my private iCloud account in OS X Mail. This separation seemed to work well, even on the iPhone, where the lack of push notifications for Sparrow ended up to be a feature for me: I didn't get a ton of notifications during the day when I was sitting in front of the computer anyway.

Reading this piece of news however prompted me to remove Sparrow and transfer my work account to Mail as well. I don't plan to invest in dead software. Anyway, on the upside, one email client eats up less resources and I have to learn only one set of keyboard shortcuts. Keeping it simple, stupid.
