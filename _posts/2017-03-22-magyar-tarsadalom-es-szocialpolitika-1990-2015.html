<blockquote>'We don't have public affairs, relations, we don't talk to each other', says Ferge, who believes this is why Széchenyi emphasised the need for a host of educated citizens. He didn't mean a select few but the whole society in general. 'This is the historical defining factor of Hungarians why citizenry never appeared here. By that I mean the consciousness of what it means to be a citizen with dignity, with rights, who is not less than any other.' — <a href="https://444.hu/2017/03/21/ferge-zsuzsa-nincsenek-kozugyeink-nincsenek-viszonyaink-nem-beszelunk-egymassal" target="_blank">444.hu</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is more of a reminder for me not to forget to buy and read this book. I want to have a better understanding of the Hungarian society and why we behave the way we do.</p>
