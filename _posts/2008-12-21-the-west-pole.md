> We are very happy and proud to announce the release of our 9th studio album in April 2009! The album will be called _The West Pole_. You probably are curious who is singing on our new record. We have found a new [female] vocalist, and we will have two [also female] guest singers on _The West Pole_.

I want it all and I want it now!
