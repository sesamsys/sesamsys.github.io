[Jimmy Carr's new DVD is out](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jimmy-Carr-Making-People-Laugh/dp/B003FMURT4), hilarious as always, (if you like his kind of rude humour). You know, he is the one with the semi-gay Oxbridge face you'd probably want to punch after a while. He even talks about journals:

> Obviously my first thought when they said do you want to write an autobiography was, well I wish I kept a journal. But I've never kept a journal, **because I'm not a fat goth girl!**

Even though I believe he meant the handwritten ones kept in the drawer of a nightstand, spot on.

Not having a TV prevents me from keeping up-to-date with current stand-up trends, nevertheless I saw a free performances here and there. Obviously there is a lot of stealing from the big names, they simply translate their jokes or adapt it to a Hungarian situation. Nevertheless I wonder if we'll ever have an openly rude and politically very incorrect stand-up guy. Compared to Jimmy (or god forbid Louis C.K.) the Hungarians are quite prude and pretty much walking the line, aren't they?
