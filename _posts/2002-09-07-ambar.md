I am having a very bad day. I started to play AO in the afternoon, but I soon abandoned it. I don't know what caused that - the servers or my computer - but AO was unplayable. I had mostly 1-2 FPS (!) not only in BS but everywhere, it lagged unbearably. Needless to mention I have lost a fair amount of XP because of this...

From that time on I had a sad, lonely feeling clouding my brain all the rest of the day. Call it a deperession or anything, but I seemed to lack the enthusiasm to do anything at all.

Finally just a few hours ago I watched TV where a Hungarian romantic comedy was broadcasted. The main character - a teacher - fell in love with one of his students. Natuarally this love had to remain unfulfilled. Being so the teacher said the following: "Why to live when there is no-one whose hand i could hold ... or who would hold my hand..." As this was a movie, it had a happy end, but is this true for real life as well? I am not sure... sadly...

Anyway the only thing I am satisfied with today is the rewritten version of my bio. I decided to rewrite it as I didn't like the previous version. I wrote it only because the pictures were ready and I wanted the site to be online. Now it reflects my life better I think. I started to add a timestamp to the posts too. Well done me. :)
