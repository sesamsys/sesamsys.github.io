    Shearer are also offering their two albums for free:

    The page is in German though and the music is rather punkish, but worth checking out if you like stuff like that.

<p>Ain't it? Well the Netherland-based <a href="http://www.silenceissexy.nl">Silence is Sexy</a> certainly thinks so. BH stumbled upon this release <a href="http://www.cyclingcolours.nl/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=7157">on The Gathering forums</a>, since their keyboardist, Frank Boeijen, plays on three of the tracks. To quote the band:</p>
<blockquote><p>Music is just like love, you have to share it. That's why we give away our new album This Ain't Hollywood for free.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think it's pretty good indie rock. Recommended for fans of Snow Patrol, Coldplay, The Bravery and alike.</p>
<p>You can download the full album in mp3 format plus a booklet and the cover image <a href="http://www.everythingyoushouldknow.info/Silence%20is%20Sexy%20-%20This%20Aint%20hollywood.zip">in a zip archive</a>. Alternatively you can find the album <a href="http://www.mininova.org/tor/1809685">on Mininova</a> if you're into torrents. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Silence+Is+Sexy/This+Ain%27t+Hollywood?autostart">Last.fm offers all the tracks for listening through their radio</a>, too. </p>
<p>And if you like what you hear, <a href="http://www.mininova.org/tor/1786190">the first album of the band is available under similar conditions</a>.</p>
