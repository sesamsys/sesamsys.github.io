I always get to posting late at night. It is half past one now. However the post will show 23th 23:59. I am backdating the posts because they really belong to the previous day not the upcoming. I have already done this with some of them.

I will try to exercise some discipline tomorrow and make myself sit down and write something earlier when I can think faster. As for now, I am off. Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite! :)
