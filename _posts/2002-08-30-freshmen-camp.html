<p>Back at home. The freshmen camp was great! :) I had the time of my life there. My group is full of very friendly people and at the end of the five days we became a real team. However we had much help doing this as this university has a very special inner 'organisation' which was set up to assist the first-years' integration to the community of the university. These students are the instructors. (We called them dementors... :) ) Every student group at the uni has two or three of them, to help them in any way. This feature is unique at the Budapest University of Economics for - as far as I know - no other uni has anything like this.</p>
<p>I guess this is it for now, I am very tired (last night party was exhausting, and I haven't slept nearly enough). More is supposed to come later. Tomorrow.</p>
