<p>My new find is <a href="http://www.myspace.com/amaranthemetal">Amaranthe</a>, a Swedish-Danish power / melodic death metal band. They started out as Avalanche back in 2008 when they released a 4-song demo. Went through a name change to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Amaranthe">Amaranthe</a> due to legal reasons and finally released their debut concept album this April. Which is good, very much so.</p>
<p>The second track, <em>Hunger</em>, was chosen as the first single:</p>
