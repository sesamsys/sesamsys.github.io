    Üdv itthon :)

    Szólj, mikor jársz Pest felé, és kerítünk valami találkozó-félét ;)

    Addigis kellemes aklimatizálódást.

    Vagy nézz körül, hova lehet elmászni Szolnokon és meglepünk mi téged. :oD
    Asszem akkor tényleg kapnál némi kultúrsokkot...

I'm home - that is in Szolnok - for now.

The flight was as good as a transcontinental flight can be. I had a good seat next to the emergency exit with extra legroom. I had a fight about my luggage weight; I had to leave some of the heavier stuff behind. The check-in girl was unwavering in her position of not letting me have a suitcase a gramme heavier than 25 kg. I gave her my plush bear.

She probably had it incinerated as soon as I left; one cannot trust fishy germ-infested presents of dirty foreigners.

I haven't done much since besides acclimatising, eating inordinate amounts of home cooking and helping around the house. Soon I'll have to start thinking about what would be next; in fact the sooner the better.

In addition to the usual (updated) [contact](http://sesam.hu/contact) possibilities [my Hungarian mobile number](http://sesam.hu/2005/12/15/flyaway) is live again. Although if anyone calls they probably won't be able to hear what I say: my old Samsung flip is finally giving in for good, either the mic or the circuits are malfunctioning. Sadly none of the old phones I found around the house seem to work any longer.

As you might have guessed the [last days in Japan tumblr project](http://sesam.tumblr.com) is over now. I managed to hang on until the 18th with the updates. I hope it wasn't entirely unenjoyable. I might continue it some undefined time later with a different theme.
