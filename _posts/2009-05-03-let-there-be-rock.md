The first few seconds I was like 'they surely can't make a game out of THAT'. And then it turns out it's not a roadie simulator after all, but something epic. I don't know how good it ends up to be but from this trailer I can conclude that this is the single best new gaming idea for a very long time now. The protagonist is a bull's-eye hit as well. [Brutal Legend](http://brutallegend.com) makes me want to own a cönsöle. (No, seriously, this held back intro doesn't really do justice to the 'hell yeah' screams I let out during the first view.)

Coming this _Rocktober!_
