> "The surviving members of Pink Floyd reunited onstage tonight at London's 02 Arena during a stop on Roger Waters' Wall tour - marking only the second time that Nick Mason, David Gilmour and Waters had played together in the last 30 years." _([Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pink-floyd-reunite-at-roger-waters-show-in-london-20110512))_

This is one of those once in a lifetime moments.
