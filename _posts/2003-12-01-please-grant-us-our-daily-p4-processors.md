Net in here is very unstable, I do hope it won't eat my post... 

The AIESEC JobNeked weekend is over - it was very exhausting but pretty much fun as well. Now we cannot stop for this weekend is a JN weekend again. We also have a ball in the university so one thing I cannot complain about and thats boredom. 

I ordered some computer parts today. in Hungary there is an opportunity for students that 60.000 HUF they spend on computer parts they can get back from their paid taxes once a year. If the student does not pay tax yet having no income either, his/her parents can use this offer as well. The offer is also available for workers paid by the state like teachers. Therefore I ordered a 2.6GHz 800MHz FSP P4 processor, two 256MB 400MHz DDR RAM modules and a GeForce FX5200 128MB videocard. I need to buy a mainboard later to bulid my little home 'power-plant'. :) Only thing is that the parts need to arrive this year or else I won't be able to get the money back next April. The shop assistant recommended daily prayers. Who knows it might help. (It's also a good idea if you have nothing to pray for include my computer parts in your prayer. ;) ) Not like I prayed ever...
