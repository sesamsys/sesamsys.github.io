  content: i suppose another $ret[$i]['artist-url'] should be there soon after. i'll
    check this one out if i have some free time, i like diving into long complicated
    scripts.

Eagle-eyed readers might have noticed that the now playing ticker now changed to display last.fm links as well. I really would have switched this option on earlier, but the artist link was bugged in the latest [scrobbler add-on for WP](http://leflo.de/projects/scrobbler).

Turned out the "bug" was really just a minor issue and took [sld](http://sld.interhost.hu/sld) about 30 seconds to fix. Here's what you should change in your phpScrobbler.php file, provided that you're using version 2.2.7 of the add-on:

`$ret[$i]['artist-url'] = "http://www.last.fm/explore/search.php?q=";`  
should be  
`$ret[$i]['artist-url'] = "http://www.last.fm/music/";`  
and just comment out the following line  
`// $ret[$i]['artist-url'] .= "&m=artists";`

Viol√°, bug fixed, %artist-url% now displays the correct link when used on the configuration panel.
