My main ultra event this year will start tomorrow. It will only be a lap around a lake… which happens to be the largest lake in Central Europe. You can follow the live timing linked below as well as check the [Instagram stories of Fanni](https://www.instagram.com/mirza_ost/) who will be my assistance on bike. 🚴‍♀️
