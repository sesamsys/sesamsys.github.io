A really disorganised post about stuff and the closing of some tabs.

Using a little hack in the gallery code I managed to squeeze the [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) tracking script in every page, so from now on the gallery hits will be displayed in the statistics as well. Of course this only concerns readers if I decide to release some of the data.

Apparently there are some [viruses for OS X](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/print_writeup.jsp?docid=2006-110217-1331-99). This one is a Symantec concept virus. Not too frightening though, if you ask me.
