<p>As far as I know until recently only the Japanese Apple subsite had separate 'Get a Mac' ads: <a href="http://www.apple.com/jp/getamac/">Macをはじめよう</a></p>
<p>But apparently there are now UK versions of the known Mac ads, which proved to be far more hilarious than the originals. British accent, British vocabulary, all the fun. Just compare "Work vs. Home" (<a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/">Apple - Get a Mac - Watch The TV Ads</a>) with "Pie Chart" (<a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/getamac/ads/">Apple (UK and Ireland) - Get a Mac - Watch The New Ads</a>)</p>
<p>"<em>For example this light gray area could represent <strong>shenanigans</strong> and <strong>tomfoolery</strong>. While this dark gray area could represent <strong>hijinks</strong>. And you see here we further divided hijinks into <strong>capers</strong>, <strong>monkey business</strong> and <strong>just larking about</strong>...</em>"</p>
<p>Instead of <em>hangout time</em> and <em>just kicking it</em>.</p>
<p>Priceless.</p>
