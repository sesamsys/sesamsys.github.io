Our host in Copenhagen had this poem fixed on her fridge:

![lykken](http://sesam.hu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2968-768x1024.jpg)

Coming home I've checked it out: it's [Lykken](http://www.bronxpoesi.dk/lykken.htm) by [Benny Andersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Andersen). His [Selected Poems](https://books.google.hu/books?id=mkx9BgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false)—which contains _Happiness_ too—is freely accessible in English on Google Books.

What I have especially liked was the last line. And serendipitously enough we've just been talking about positive psychology at one of my meetings today.
