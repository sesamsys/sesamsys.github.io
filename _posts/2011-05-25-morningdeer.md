This is so fresh it just came out yesterday. I don't know who she/he/they is/are but [morningdeer's](http://morningdeer.bandcamp.com) new LP, _days_ , is quite an interesting listen. Expect experimental avantpop sometimes spiced with unlikely sound effects that reminds of Ã‰milie Simon. The whole shebang is [free on bandcamp](http://morningdeer.bandcamp.com/album/days) and available in both lossless and lossy formats. I recommend checking out _floor_ at least:
