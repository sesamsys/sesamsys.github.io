One of the guild members in [pvc](http://autopatch.de) is studying films. He set out to make a movie, and just recently shared this teaser with us. I think it's quite epic. Only if I was his editor I'd change the taglines a bit. Nevertheless, [pjn](http://armory.wow-europe.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Turalyon&n=Qvait)'s [pvc - return (teaser)](http://vimeo.com/2977159):

[vimeo width="600" height="337"]http://vimeo.com/2977159[/vimeo]

Sidenotes: That Patchwerk kill was quite epic, half the raid dead and Alice, our healer, moonfiring PW to death. And we worked quite hard to finally see Malygos drop to the void like that.
