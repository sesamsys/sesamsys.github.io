I just love this comic ([now with recommendation from your friendly psychiatrist](http://isolde.hu/archives/2008/04/04/Duhkezelesi_strategiak_az_interneten_part_1)):

![Venting](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/venting.png)

The day when they make a machine that shocks you with high voltage electricity when you write something like "your a fag stfu" I'd die happy. Not that I never make spelling or grammatical mistakes, but when someone's whole contribution to the internet reeks of primeval stupidity...

And don't forget, she can kill you with her brain.
