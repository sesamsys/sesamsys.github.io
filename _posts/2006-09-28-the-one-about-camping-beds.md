It's been... interesting around here lately, and I wasn't too eager to post as you can see. Not to mention the fact that people were - likely - reading an entirely different blog last week. Which is not really an excuse though. Moreover, if our PM has the time to write than I definitely should too.

Instead I was sitting on a tattered camping bed probably older than I am in our garden reading [The Devil Wears Prada](http://www.amazon.com/Devil-Wears-Prada-Lauren-Weisberger/dp/0307275558/sr=8-2/qid=1159452512/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-9432202-7850411?ie=UTF8&s=books). Mostly girl stuff again. I like it nevertheless, weird as I am.
