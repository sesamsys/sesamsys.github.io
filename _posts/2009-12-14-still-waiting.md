> _So the day became one of waiting, which was, he knew, a sin: moments were to be experienced; waiting was a sin against both the time that was still to come and the moments one was currently disregarding._

Neil Gaiman: Neverwhere

Even though I agree with the above I don't seem to possess the knowledge how to let go of things that are not in my power to change.

Besides recently everything appears to be about testing patience.

I used to wait for the exams to come then wait for the results to be released. Then I waited for the day to come back home. Nowadays I'm waiting for replies to my job applications. (In which case it's not advised for one to hold one's breath.)

I also waited for my packages I sent from Japan to arrive, especially my desktop computer. It turns out it actually did a while ago, around the 20th of November. The Hungarian Post wasn't in any hurry to inform me though: I only received a letter last Friday.

The catch is, of course, that customs tax is supposed to be paid, and a lot of it. So now the waiting is about whether the computer gets released it for what it is, a used item part of a moving, or my requests would be refused, in which case I'd be out of ideas as to how to proceed.
