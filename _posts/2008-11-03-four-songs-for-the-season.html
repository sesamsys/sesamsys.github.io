<p>A weird coincidence or just the courtesy of fall that last week two friends - both of them in my year of studies - told me separately how they feel permanently down lately. As if our time here has taken its toll. I'm mostly of the same mood. We're going through the motions, dazed and confused, comfortably numb. This is the life.</p>
