I am too exhausted to think. And I am not good enough yet to write a post without thinking just out of pure imagination. Basicly I had a tiring and very very hot day. Even when I woke up it was so hot as if it had been early afternnon already. I went to the hairdresser and got soaking wet in the seat covered with a vinly cloth. In the afternoon it rained, but it didn't last long and soon it was so hot like nothing interfered. It is hot now even. And I cant sleep well under extreme temperatures.
