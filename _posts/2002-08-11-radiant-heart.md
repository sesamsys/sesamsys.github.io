I haven't done a post in some time now. This is because I was obsessed with playing Anarchy Online. Since 2 days I have left Velvet - not because I didn't like it there, I had the time of my life - but I wanted to fulfill my dreams. So with a fellow adventurer and a good friend, {Knightsabre}, we founded a new Anarchy Online organisation, under the name {Radiant Heart}. We aim to be a helpful and kind guild, in which members have a good time and much fun of playing. May we be successful on our quest. :)

I am still disappointed as SeSam.hu is still not online. Semms like the web space provider works slowly a bit...

Yesterday I watched a movie too: Along Came a Spider. It was thrillingly exciting. A well-written story that chained me into the chair to the very end. The story is about a kidnap, but the plot twists and turns so fast in the end that is impressive. And I have to mention the main female character who is played by Monica Potter. To tell you the truth i haven't ever seen the girl in any movie yet. But she looks very pretty IMHO. And she resembles exactly to my Anarchy Online character! :) I hope I can see her again in something...

And there is a movie I want to see. A.I. - Artificial Intelligence. I am highly looking forvard to this piece as it got excellent critics in {Hungary}. Before getting the movie, I checked out its {website}. It is truly amazing! Everyone should try Chatbot! She is a robot with AI that can answer your questions and can chat with you. I couldn't think of a question yet she couldn't answer. I am curious how could she be written... She looks terribly intelligent. Congrats, creators!
