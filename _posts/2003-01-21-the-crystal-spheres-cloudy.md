Being very sad and tired what could I write? I should go for a job in the future-telling business as I foretold my analysis result again. Well, it was of course not that difficult to do. It is 12 points, an F (or here a 1). I am wondering what comes next.

Currently I am bored to hell sitting at the Salthouse and doing absolutely nothing. I am waiting for my mark in history of civilisations and I have still an hour to wait. So with this flushed mind don't expect any useful good-to-read posts. Still I am keeping my promise to post more regularly. Here you go. ;)
