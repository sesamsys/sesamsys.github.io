<p>I was excited to start using Apple's new OS but it seems that the release has been marred by widespread problems regarding the Up-To-Date Program. Since my Air was bought after the WWDC, I am eligible for a redemption code for the App Store to upgrade to ML free of charge, which arrived in an email in matters of minutes. However, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/07/25/apples-os-x-mountain-lion-up-to-date-program-experiencing-early-hiccups/">along with several others</a>, the code I have received claims to have already been used, which I sure as hell haven't done. Reports suggest it may take days to receive new working ones. Not to try to look a gift horse in the mouth, this still could have been done a lot smoother.</p>
